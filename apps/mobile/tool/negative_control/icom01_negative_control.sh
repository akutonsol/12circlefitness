# I-COM-01 / DAT-4 — negative control for the event-registration guard,
# Wave 3A task 3A-6.
#
# QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD §2 defines VERIFIED IN CI as a check that "fails against
# the pre-fix tree and passes against the post-fix tree, IN CI". The guard in
# apps/mobile/test/unit/event_registration_contract_test.dart landed in the same
# commit that removed the defect, so on its own no run has ever seen it fail.
# This harness supplies the missing half.
#
# THE PRE-FIX STATE IS REAL, NOT SYNTHETIC. The fabricating catch has existed
# since the initial commit and was removed by this harness's sibling commit, so
# the implementation commit's own PARENT carries the genuine defect:
# `_register()` there invents a `TKT-DEMO-…` code and sets `_registered = true`
# inside its catch. A defective tree is therefore recoverable from history and
# **G-3 is NOT invoked**. This step must never be filed alongside the WKT-204
# and M-1/M-2/M-3 steps, which are of that synthetic class.
#
# It follows ec23_negative_control.sh and uix1_negative_control.sh exactly:
# install the pre-fix state, require the declared failure, restore
# byte-identically, require the pass again. It does not touch application
# behaviour, does not weaken the guard, and contacts nothing.
