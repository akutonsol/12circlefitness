# I-WRK-01 · VERIFIED LIVE — post-fix and pre-fix legs against ONE live QA fixture.
#
# `QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md` §2 defines VERIFIED LIVE as "a real request against QA
# [that] reproduces the correct behaviour, **and the same probe demonstrably
# failed before the fix**". This script produces both halves and refuses to
# report either one unless it is genuine.
#
# ── WHAT RUNS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   1. POST-FIX  the current tree, mode=seed-and-read. Creates the fixture and
#                asserts the full progression. Must PASS.
#   2. PRE-FIX   a git worktree at 654b09c^ (the REAL parent — no fabricated
#                copy, no history rewrite), mode=read-only, SAME fixture rows.
#                Must FAIL, and must fail for the one right reason.
#   3. CLEANUP   the current tree, mode=cleanup. Deletes the fixture and proves
#                zero rows remain.
#
# The probe file is copied into the pre-fix worktree because it did not exist
# historically. That copy is the TEST; the `lib/` under test is genuinely
# acd2cc5's, which is the half that matters. Both legs execute a byte-identical
# probe against byte-identical fixture rows.
#
# ── DISCRIMINATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A non-zero exit is NOT evidence. The pre-fix leg counts only if every one of
# these is true, and the script checks each:
#     BOOT ok              Flutter started and Supabase initialised
#     AUTH ok              the fixture identity authenticated
#     FIXTURE present=4    the same rows the post-fix leg asserted are readable
#     SERVICE-CALLED       the real getExerciseProgression() was invoked
#     RESULT len=0         it returned [] — the historical signature
#     ASSERT-NONEMPTY FAIL the non-empty expectation is what failed
#     exit != 0
# Anything else — a compile error, an auth failure, a network failure, a missing
# fixture, a THROW instead of [] — is INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE and the script
# exits non-zero WITHOUT claiming pre-fix evidence. If the pre-fix tree returns
# data, that is a hard failure too: it would mean the fixture is not being read.
#
#   apps/mobile/tool/negative_control/wrk01_live_probe.sh
#
# Exit 0 only when all three legs did exactly what they must.
