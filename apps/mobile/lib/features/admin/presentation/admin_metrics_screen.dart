/// V5 §167 — the host for [AdminMetricsPanel]: the owner-approved Admin metrics.
///
/// A NEW ROUTE RATHER THAN A CHANGE TO THE LEGACY CONSOLE. `/admin-dashboard` is the
/// pre-token screen, styled from its own private palette. Mounting a token-styled
/// panel inside it would produce a screen in two visual languages, and restyling that
/// screen is a product decision, not something to do in passing. §12's rule is to
/// extend additively, so this is additive: nothing about the legacy console changes.
///
/// WHY NO CLIENT-SIDE ROLE GUARD IS ADDED HERE. The admin routes in `app_router.dart`
/// are not role-gated, and the enforcement that matters is server-side — every surface
/// this page reads gates on `admin_can` inside the view's own `WHERE`, so a caller
/// without the capability receives no row no matter how they arrived. Adding a client
/// check would be defence in depth, but it would also be the only check a reader
/// sees, and a client-side gate that *looks* like the boundary is worse than none.
/// What a non-admin sees here is every card saying "Not available to your role",
/// which is both true and the correct `A11` state.
