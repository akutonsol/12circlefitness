/// WHY THERE IS NO `quiet` VARIANT OF THE GATE, which §189 tried to add and `EC-G7`

/// so the obvious move was a flag that rendered the two non-answer states as nothing. That
/// introduces `error: (…) => SizedBox.shrink()` — the exact RC-C shape `EC-G7` ratchets,
/// where a failure and an empty state render identically. The guard was right, and raising
/// its baseline to accommodate this would have been weakening a guard to go green.
///
/// A ROW SLOT NEEDS NO GATE. The decision is made ONCE by the parent, which holds the
/// `AsyncValue`, and each row receives a plain `bool` — so there is no per-row error branch
/// to be silent in. The parent then owes [adminGatedList] around the list, which is
/// where a failed check gets its sentence. `SEC-G9` enforces that pairing, because the
/// arrangement is only honest while something is still speaking.

/// Renders a ROW LIST whose actions depend on a capability, keeping all four states apart
/// without ever hiding the rows.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A `.valueOrNull` READ. §189 needed a row list whose
/// per-row action appears only for a confirmed `·update`, and tried three shapes that three
/// different guards rejected — each correctly:
///
///   * **`adminCapabilityGate` around the list** (`SEC-G9`). A gate chooses between two
///     widgets, so its honest *"Checking your permissions…"* REPLACED EVERY ROW — hiding
///     records a `·view` capability had already authorized because an answer about a
///     different verb had not arrived. The emptiness then reads as *"there is nothing
///     here"*: the false zero this programme exists to prevent, reached through
///     authorization instead of through a `?? 0`.
///   * **a `quiet` flag on the gate** (`EC-G7`). Silencing the two non-answer states
///     introduces `error: (…) => SizedBox.shrink()`, the RC-C shape where a failure and an
///     empty state render identically.
///   * **`capability.valueOrNull == true` in the parent** (`EC-G8`). `admin_can` is an RPC,
///     so it does I/O, and that read collapses *"could not ask"* into *"no"* at the call
///     site. EC-G8's own note refuses the escape hatch in terms: the indistinguishability
///     *"is the argument for a typed error state, not a bigger allowlist"*.
///
/// So the decision is made ONCE, in a single `when` whose **error arm renders the rows AND
/// states the failure**. Nothing is silent, nothing is hidden, and no state is collapsed:
///
///   * **loading** — rows, no action, nothing said; there is no answer yet and the action
///     has simply not appeared.
///   * **failed** — rows, no action, and the sentence that this is NOT a denial.
///   * **false** — rows, no action, and the approved read-only state naming the capability.
///   * **true** — rows, with the action.
