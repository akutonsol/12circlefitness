///
/// The pure half: how a week of check-in history reads, and what the screen is
/// allowed to say when the read fails.
///
/// ── THE ROW THE ANCHOR DRAWS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
/// `Week 13 · Energy steady · Nadia replied`. Three parts, and only two of them
/// can be built from this repository's data without a decision:
///
///   * `Week 13` — `WeeklyCheckin.weekNumber`.
///   * `Nadia replied` — `feedback.coachName`, or the package's own
///     "Awaiting reply" (FIT-025's screen name) when there is none.
///   * `Energy steady` — **not built.** The stored value is 1–5. Turning it
///     into Low / Steady / Strong means choosing thresholds on a number a coach
///     reads, which is the same decision FIT-004's difficulty mapping is
///     blocked on (OD-16). The row reports `Energy 3 of 5` instead — the exact
///     phrasing already used for these controls' accessible names — which
///     states the data without interpreting it.
///
/// ── AND THE RULE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// Same as FIT-005 and FIT-027, because it is the same defect class: **a failed
/// history read must never be drawn as "no history".** Under a heading that
/// says history, an absence is an answer — it tells a client who has checked in
/// for thirteen weeks that they never have.
