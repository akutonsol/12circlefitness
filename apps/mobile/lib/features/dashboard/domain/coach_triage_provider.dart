/// authorized and why `workout_logs` is not one of them. This file is only the
/// reads.
///
/// ── TWO DISCIPLINES THIS FILE IS HELD TO ───────────────────────────────────
/// **Errors propagate.** Not one `catch { return []; }`. F-15 is the record of
/// what that costs on this exact screen: a failed read reached the coach as
/// "no clients", "no check-ins", "no workouts" — their whole roster, gone. A
/// throw here becomes an `AsyncError` the surface can state.
///
/// **No `workout_logs`.** SEC-G3 forbids it and `QA_EVIDENCE §3ah` explains
/// why: RLS denies a coach's read and PostgREST answers `200` with `[]`, so an
/// `At risk` row built on it would fire for every client, always.
///
/// ── AND ONE THING IT CANNOT PROVE ──────────────────────────────────────────
/// The `Assign` signal reads `workout_program_assignments`, one of SEC-G2's
/// four two-party tables. The rows can be read; their **authenticity** is what
/// F-21/OD-14 leaves open. Same standing as `/workout-detail`: the surface may
/// be built, and it must not claim the assignment behind it is genuine.
