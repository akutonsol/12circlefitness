/// FIT-028 — "/messages · the state that sells the plan honestly".
///
/// The anchor asks for a *fourth* state on an otherwise three-state screen:
/// loading, failed, empty, and now "you have no coach, here is how to get one".
/// The interesting part is not that the pitch renders — it is that it renders
/// **only on proof**, because the two ways of getting it wrong are both
/// user-visible harms:
///
///  * showing "No coach yet · Find a coach" to a member who already pays a
///    coach, because the coach lookup happened to fail (the error-to-empty
///    collapse recorded as F-15); and
///  * showing it to a coach who simply has no client messages yet.
///
/// So every assertion below is about a state that must NOT become the pitch.
/// The tests are written against the real widget tree with only the three data
/// providers overridden, so they fail if the branch is rewired — unlike the
/// simulated-logic tests `QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD` §4 warns about.
