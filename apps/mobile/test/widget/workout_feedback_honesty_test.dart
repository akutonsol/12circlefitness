/// F-23 — the session-complete dialog told the client their feedback had
/// reached their coach when it had not.
///
/// ── THE DEFECT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// `_saveFeedback` ended `catch (_) {}` and then set `_submitted = true`
/// unconditionally. Every failure — no network, RLS refusal, a malformed row —
/// produced the same screen as success: a green tick and the words
/// **"Feedback sent to your coach!"**. The dialog then offered only "Back to
/// Home", so the notes were gone and unrecoverable. The client had written
/// something for their coach, been told it was delivered, and it was not.
///
/// That is a fabricated UI state, which is the specific thing this programme's
/// brief forbids. It is also the F-15 error→empty pattern in its most harmful
/// form: not a failure shown as emptiness, but a failure shown as success.
///
/// ── WHY THREE OUTCOMES AND NOT TWO ─────────────────────────────────────────
/// The write is two inserts that fail independently. If the feedback row saves
/// but the coach's notification does not, retracting the save would be a second
/// falsehood — the notes *are* stored. And a client with **no coach at all**
/// was also being told their feedback had been sent to one. So:
///
///   failed    → nothing written; keep the form, keep the values, offer a retry
///   saved     → written, nobody notified; say saved, do not claim delivery
///   delivered → written and the coach pinged; the original line is true
///
/// ── WHY THE DIALOG TAKES A `submit` CALLBACK ───────────────────────────────
/// Its real path reads `Supabase.instance`, which no widget test can provide,
/// so before this change the defect was unreachable from a test — which is
/// part of why it survived. The seam exists to make each outcome assertable.

  /// The dialog is taller than the default 800x600 test surface, so Submit
  /// falls outside it and a tap silently misses — which is exactly how a
  /// trivially-passing test gets written.
  ///
  /// The width is 700 and **that is not the phone width on purpose.** At 420 dp
  /// this harness reported `A RenderFlex overflowed by 18 pixels` from the
  /// Duration/Calories/Idle row. Widget tests render in Ahem, where every glyph
  /// is a full em square, so text measures wider than any real font — the
  /// overflow is the harness, not the product. That was settled by measuring on
  /// the device instead: `integration_test/fit018_complete_dialog_device_test`
  /// mounts the same dialog on `emulator-5554` at 411, 390 and 360 dp with the
  /// real font and reports zero overflows at all three, with the row at
  /// 283.4 / 262.0 / 232.0 dp inside its constraints.
  ///
  /// So layout is asserted on the device, where the measurement means
  /// something, and this file gets a surface wide enough that Ahem's inflation
  /// cannot drown the behaviour it is actually testing.
