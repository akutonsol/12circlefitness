/// EC-04 · what a coach using a SCREEN READER is told about an unassessed client.
///
/// The fix distinguishes "unassessed" from "low risk" by COLOUR and by LABEL. A screen
/// reader conveys no colour, so if the label did not reach the accessibility tree the
/// defect would persist for exactly the users least able to notice it — and EC-04's harm
/// is a coach being told a client is low risk when nobody assessed them.
///
/// THE SEMANTICS TREE IS AVAILABLE ON THE HOST, so this assertion does not need a device
/// and is not deferred to one. The sibling device probe
/// (`integration_test/ec04_risk_badge_device_test.dart`) keeps only what genuinely needs
/// real hardware: the real font at a real device pixel ratio, where Ahem's full-em
/// squares cannot answer whether the label fits its pill.
///
/// Nothing is signed in: `clientDetailProvider` is overridden with an in-memory profile.
