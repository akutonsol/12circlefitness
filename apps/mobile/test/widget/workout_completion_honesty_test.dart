// EC-05 / N-07 · "Workout completion swallows persistence and celebrates
// anyway" — docs/MASTER_REMEDIATION_REGISTRY.md:53, CONFIRMED.
//
// `test/unit/workout_save_test.dart` pins what the RULE says. This pins that
// the SCREEN is wired to it.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS SOURCE AND NOT A PUMPED SCREEN ─────────────────────────────
// `ActiveWorkoutScreen` cannot be pumped with a workout selected. Two of the
// three obstacles were genuine testability defects and were fixed — an eager
// `final _db = Supabase.instance.client` on the State, and the same in
// `CustomExerciseService`, both now resolved on use, which is the rule
// `WorkoutService` already states for itself.
//
// The third is not a defect: `initState` calls `_startSession`, which reads
// `_db.auth.currentUser`. Starting a session on mount is what this screen is
// FOR. Getting past it needs a Supabase test harness with a signed-in user,
// which does not exist in this repository.
//
// So these are source assertions, labelled as such, and worth exactly what
// source assertions are worth: they prove the guard is wired, not that it
// behaves. The behaviour is pinned one layer down, on rules a test can reach.
// A Supabase-backed harness is recorded as the missing dependency.
