/// VOICE-G1 — a voice note that did not send must not look like one that did,
/// and the capture must not be left on the device.
///
/// ── WHY THIS IS A SOURCE GUARD ─────────────────────────────────────────────
/// The file says so itself, in its own header:
///
/// > *"audio capture/playback is device/browser-specific and cannot be verified
/// > headlessly — this needs on-device testing (mic permission + capture +
/// > upload + playback across web/iOS/Android)."*
///
/// `AudioRecorder` and `CustomExerciseService` are both constructed as fields,
/// so neither can be substituted, and the widget cannot be pumped through a
/// real record → upload cycle in a test. These assertions prove the branches
/// exist; the header's on-device run is what proves they work. Recorded that
/// way rather than dressed up.
