// REL-3 — QA tooling must not ship in a release build.
//
// `/qa-center` and `/mie-debugger` were registered unconditionally in the
// shipping router. `QaCenterScreen` checks `kReleaseMode` inside its own
// `build` and draws a placeholder, but a screen that declines to draw is not a
// route that declines to exist: the path still resolved, still showed up in the
// web URL bar, and `MieDebuggerScreen` — which reads decision traces — had no
// check of any kind.
//
// `kReleaseMode` is a compile-time constant, so a debug test binary cannot flip
// it. `buildQaToolingRoutes` takes the flag as a parameter for exactly that
// reason, and these tests drive the REAL route-building code with it set both
// ways — including through a real GoRouter, so what is asserted is resolution
// behaviour and not just a list length.
