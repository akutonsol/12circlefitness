/// ERR-G2 — no raw exception may be interpolated into user-facing copy.
///
/// A PostgREST/Postgres error is not opaque. It carries table and column
/// names, constraint text, and on a unique violation the **conflicting
/// value**. `SEC-PHI-2` closed the two PHI screens and said so explicitly in
/// its own header:
///
/// > *"It does not claim the app never leaks an exception: five other sites
/// > still do (recorded, all on non-PHI coach screens)."*
///
/// A sweep found the real number was **38**, across 26 files, including
/// `womens_health_screen.dart` and the admin console — whose error card both
/// parsed the exception for its "not an admin" branch *and* printed the raw
/// text for every other error, to exactly the non-admin audience that branch
/// exists for.
///
/// All 38 are closed. This guard is what stops the count climbing back, and
/// it replaces a prose disclaimer with an enforced number.
///
/// ── WHAT COUNTS, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ────────────────────────────
/// Only a **bare** interpolation inside a string literal counts: `$e`, `${e}`,
/// `$error`, `$err`, `$ex`. `${e.key}`, `${ex.name}` and `${e['score']}` are
/// loop and map variables that merely share a name — an early version of this
/// sweep counted them and reported 59 sites for 38 real ones.
///
/// Three uses are legitimate and are listed, not silently skipped:
///   * the observability sink, whose job is to format the exception;
///   * parsing (`'$e'.contains('42501')`) with no display;
///   * stringifying a list element that happens to be called `e`.
void main() {

  /// Keyed by file, but each entry lists the exact CODE FRAGMENTS that are
  /// exempt — not the file. A file-granular allowlist gave every line in a
  /// listed file a blanket pass, and mutation testing caught it: planting
  /// `'Upload failed: $e'` in `progress_screen.dart` SURVIVED, because that
  /// file was listed for an unrelated storage path. Two of the five listed
  /// files are PHI-adjacent, so a blanket pass was the wrong shape.
  ///
  /// This list may shrink, never grow.
