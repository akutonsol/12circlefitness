// UIX-2 (text half) — the app must not claim a deletion path it does not have.
//
// App Store Guideline 5.1.1(v) makes in-app account deletion mandatory for any
// app that supports account creation. 12 Circle has no such affordance: the
// Settings "Account" section holds Subscription, Connected Apps, units, heart
// rate zones and notification preferences, and nothing else.
//
// It nonetheless told users, in two places, to use one:
//   help_center_screen.dart   "Go to Profile → Settings → Account → Delete Account"
//   privacy_policy_screen.dart "You may delete your account from Profile → Settings → Account"
//
// The feature itself is Wave 7 and is blocked behind I-USR-01(a) — 53 of 143
// foreign keys restrict deletes, so deletion is blocked at the schema level
// before it is blocked at the UI level. This guard covers only the half that
// needed no decision: the false statement should not outlive Wave 1, and must
// not come back before the feature does.
