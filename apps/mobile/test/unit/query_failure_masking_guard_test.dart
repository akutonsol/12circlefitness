/// ERR-G1 — a QUERY must not answer with a value when it failed.
///
/// ── THE CLASS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// ```dart
/// Future<int> getCurrentStreak() async {
///   …
///   } catch (_) { return 0; }      // "your streak is zero"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `false` and `0` are **answers**. Returned from a `catch`, they are answers
/// the method does not have. This is the defect behind A-G5: `train_hub`
/// rendered `error: (_, __) => '—'` and that arm **could never run**, because
/// the service turned every failure into `AsyncData(0)` before the provider
/// saw it. The repair had been made at the presentation layer, over a service
/// that destroyed the signal it needed.
///
/// ── WHAT IS AND IS NOT COVERED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
/// This targets **queries** — methods whose name asks a question (`has…`,
/// `get…`, `is…`, `count…`, `fetch…`, `load…`, `check…`, `current…`,
/// `total…`) returning `bool`/`int`/`double`.
///
/// It deliberately does **not** target ACTIONS. `Future<bool> saveX()`
/// returning `false` from a catch is correct: "it did not work" is exactly
/// what the caller asked. Conflating the two would force a wrong fix on ~29
/// call sites.
///
/// It also does not cover `return []` / `return null`. An empty list is
/// sometimes a legitimate degraded answer and the nine harmful cases are
/// already closed and recorded (F-15, §3o). Widening this guard to catch them
/// would need product copy that does not exist, which is OD-8's ruling.
