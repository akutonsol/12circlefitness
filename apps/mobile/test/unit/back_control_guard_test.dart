/// BACK-G1 — a back control must carry a name.
///
/// ── WHY BACK, SPECIFICALLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// `Back` is the single most declared interaction in the design package — it
/// appears on most frames — and it is always drawn as a bare glyph. An
/// `IconButton` whose child is an `Icon` and which has no `tooltip:` has **no
/// accessible name at all**: a screen reader announces "button" and stops.
/// Flutter's own `BackButton` gets its name from `MaterialLocalizations`; a
/// hand-rolled `IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back))` gets nothing.
///
/// A bare `GestureDetector` around the same icon is worse again — no name and
/// no button role.
///
/// ── THE COUNT THIS GUARD ALMOST SHIPPED WITH ───────────────────────────────
/// The first sweep reported **40 unnamed back buttons**. That number was
/// wrong, threefold, for two reasons worth keeping written down:
///
///   1. it matched `IconButton(` as a **substring of `NamedIconButton(`**, so
///      six controls this programme had already fixed were counted as
///      defects — the "string substrings being counted as controls" failure
///      exactly;
///   2. it never looked far enough out to see a `Semantics(button: true,
///      label: 'Back')` wrapper, so four more correct sites were counted too.
///
/// The verified figure was **16**: thirteen unnamed `IconButton`s and three
/// bare `GestureDetector`s. All sixteen are fixed, so this guard sits at
/// **zero** — and matches constructor names as whole words.
/// Does anything give this back control a name?
///
/// Lifted out of the scan so it can be pinned on its own. Left inline, a
/// mutation making it unconditionally `true` SURVIVED the whole guard: the
/// floor test only counted controls, and the ratchet then had nothing to find.
/// A predicate that never says "no" is not a predicate.
