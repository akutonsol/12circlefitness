-- PROPOSED MIGRATION — N-07 Coach Client Assessment
--
-- NOT YET A MIGRATION. `docs/MASTER_REMEDIATION_WAVES.md` §0.2 assigns numbers
-- 132+ "at wave entry, never before", so this file deliberately carries no
-- number and does not sit in supabase/migrations/. On wave entry: rename to
-- NNN_assessment_access.sql, move, and commit in the same change (the hygiene
-- guard fails on any untracked migration).
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- N-07 requires: "A coach may only access assessment/intake data belonging to
-- their assigned clients. Do not expose assessment data for unassigned
-- clients", with the privacy copy "Only you and Amara can see this. Opening it
-- is logged."
--
-- Two facts make that impossible on the existing path:
--
--  1. Intake writes 32 columns onto `user_profiles`, including `parq_answers`,
--     `risk_level`, `risk_score`, `medical_conditions`, `has_injuries`,
--     `injury_locations`, `injury_description` and `food_allergies`.
--
--  2. Migration 102's SELECT policy grants the WHOLE ROW to
--        id = auth.uid()
--        OR public.is_active_coach_of(id)
--        OR public.is_team_lead_of(id)      -- head coach, coach_team_members
--        OR public.hosts_event_for(id)      -- ANY event vendor the client
--                                           -- registered with
--     102's own header shows the last two were added for a team ROSTER and an
--     attendee LIST -- i.e. for names. They nonetheless carry the medical
--     columns with them.
--
-- So today an event vendor can read the PAR-Q answers and injury history of
-- anyone who registered for their event, and the N-07 copy would be false.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- APPROACH — additive, not a policy rewrite
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- This does NOT alter migration 102's policy. Narrowing that policy would
-- break coach_business_screen (team roster) and vendor_portal_screen
-- (attendee list), both of which legitimately need names.
--
-- Instead it adds a dedicated, narrow read path for assessment data which
-- admits ONLY the active assigned coach -- not team leads, not event hosts --
-- and which records every access. The residual exposure on the base table is
-- recorded separately as a security finding (see docs section at the bottom).
--
-- This mirrors the pattern 102 itself established for messaging: a narrow
-- authorization predicate plus a projection, rather than a row grant.

-- 2. The narrow read path.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- VOLATILE (the default for plpgsql) because it writes the audit row; a STABLE
-- function could not. SECURITY DEFINER so the authorization check and the log
-- write are not themselves filtered by RLS. search_path pinned, per the
-- standing requirement recorded in the security workstream.
