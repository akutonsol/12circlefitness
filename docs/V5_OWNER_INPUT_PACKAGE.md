## 0 · A CORRECTION I MUST LEAD WITH — `P5` IS FAR CLOSER THAN I REPORTED

My last two reports said `P5` was blocked on four missing design artifacts: the 11 Admin states, responsive
behaviour, component specifications and iconography.

**Three of those four are DELIVERED.** I was quoting the `CONF-D5` README, which describes what **four
screenshots** do not establish — **not** what the published design package contains. The package lives on
`origin/design/12circle-plus-admin-dashboard` and I had already ingested it once (§103).

| artifact | what I said | what is actually there |
|---|---|---|
| **Responsive** | "unspecified" | ✅ **`RESPONSIVE.md`** — five breakpoints (1439 · 1400 · 1199/1180 · 1100 · 900), tables scroll inside their card, no horizontal page scroll, `prefers-reduced-motion` removes animation |
| **Iconography** | "unspecified" | ✅ **`brand/icons/admin-icon-inventory.md`** — Phosphor Icons v2.1.1, `regular` default / `fill` for active, **107 icons enumerated with usage counts** |
| **Admin tokens** | implied missing | ✅ **`brand/tokens/admin.tokens.css|json`** + `admin.contrast.md` |
| **11 Admin states** | "ENUMERATED, NOT DESIGNED … no frames" | ⚠ **STALE.** `V5_ADMIN_DESIGN_HELIX_RECONCILIATION §1.4` already recorded this: **ten designed state patterns** exist |
| **Component specs** | "unspecified" | ⚠ **genuinely missing** — `COMPONENTS.md` says so itself |

**And `BOUNDARIES G` dissolves on inspection.** It asks whether the Admin's `--adm-*` tokens conflict with
the Helix tiers. They do not — `admin.tokens.css` ships **exactly** the values the application ships:
`#0a0a0b`, `#121215`, `#f4f3f6`, `#9b96a3`, `#7c3aed`, and all three of violet `#7C3AED` · amber `#E0A030` ·
green `#2FBF87`. **The design package's Admin tokens and the shipped implementation are the same token set**,
which is what `CONF-D6-B` locked.

## A · DESIGN AUTHORITY REQUIRED — the only two real gaps

### `DESIGN-01` · Two `A11` state frames

**FACTS.** `A11` requires eleven screen states. `SCREEN-INVENTORY.md` delivers **ten** designed patterns —
Loading · Empty · Error · Permission-denied · Degraded across all six pages, plus Unavailable · Stale ·
Offline · Skeleton · Read-only, with dedicated *"State system"* panels on People, Trust, Operations and
Settings. **Two `A11` states have no frame: `critical-incident` and `Guardian-approval-required`.** The
design also adds four states `A11` never named, preserved as approved capability under §102.

**REQUIRED.** Frames for those two states.

**DEPENDENCY NOTE — and I am retracting a claim.** I previously said responsive, components and iconography
*"follow from"* the state designs. **The governing record establishes no such dependency, and I should not
have asserted one.** The three are independent artifacts; two are already delivered.

**UNBLOCKS.** `Guardian-approval-required` is the state the `P7` approval queue will render. `critical-incident`
is the Incidents area's severity-`Critical` presentation.

**STATUS — DESIGN AUTHORITY REQUIRED.**

### `DESIGN-02` · Per-component specification sheets

**FACTS.** `COMPONENTS.md` enumerates the component set in use — shell (environment strip 34px, six-item nav
header, user menu, search), containers (card, panel, drawer, dialog, menu) and the rest, **≈30 types**. It
then states plainly: *"A separate per-component specification sheet (anatomy, variants, spacing annotations)
has **not** been produced. Listed as missing."* The Helix implementation ships **3** of ≈30 (`Button`,
`Card`, `MetricReadout`).

**REQUIRED.** Anatomy, variants and spacing per component — or a ruling that the six `.dc.html` screens are
sufficient specification and components may be derived from them.

**STATUS — DESIGN AUTHORITY REQUIRED.**

## B · OWNER DECISIONS — the twelve metric IDs

**There are 12 decision IDs across 11 cards** — Revenue carries two. I have previously said "eleven"; that is
the card count.

**§C.3 contains no recommendation lines and no approved answers**, so none of these is answered. **Two,
however, have their *semantic* half already settled by an owner direction in the record**, which I verified at
source rather than trusting the pack's paraphrase.

| ID | card | exact question | options | producer today | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **METRIC-02** | Active users / DAU | does a **sign-in with no Session** count as active? | 1 Session only · 2 sign-in counts · 3 both, shown separately | none | OWNER |
| **METRIC-03** | Active coaches | *"this month"* = **calendar month** or **trailing 30 days**? | 1 calendar · 2 trailing 30d | `coach_client_relationships` | OWNER |
| **METRIC-05** | Wellness partners | the **approval state machine** — *"9 awaiting approval"* implies states the schema lacks | 1 define now · 2 total only · 3 `A11` for the sub-count | `user_profiles role='vendor'` | OWNER |
| **METRIC-06a** | Revenue | **`PD-C03` currency** — `'usd'` hardcoded; card shows **£** | 1 single-currency USD + explicit FX · 2 multi-currency | `payments.amount_cents` | OWNER |
| **METRIC-06b** | Revenue | is *"coaching"* **gross** or **platform commission**? | 1 all three (gross/commission/net) · 2 gross only · 3 net only | `marketplace_commission_rate` 0.10 | OWNER — **see note ①** |
| **METRIC-11** | QA & release | **V5 gate ledger** or **CI status**? They disagree (CI green, 8 of 15 gates FAIL) | 1 CI · 2 gate ledger · 3 both, labelled | GitHub Actions | OWNER |
| **METRIC-12** | Attention queue | severity vocabulary: approved UI `CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW` vs shipped `Critical/High/Warning/Informational` (`143:70`) | 1 UI adopts shipped enum · 2 change the enum (**`D4`/`A11` population change**) · 3 display-map | `audit_incidents.severity` | OWNER |
| **METRIC-13** | Ecosystem activity | what a *"pod"* is (`86 pods`) | 1 `accountability_pods` · 2 `community_groups` · 3 other | both tables exist | OWNER |
| **METRIC-14** | Events / community | which *"74% attendance"* means | 1 registrations ÷ capacity · 2 attended ÷ registered (**no attendance column**) · 3 bookings ÷ capacity | `event_registrations` | OWNER |
| **METRIC-16** | Installs | `PD-A24`=`C` forecloses an analytics vendor; is reading **our own** consoles that? | 1 not a vendor · 2 it is — `A11` empty · 3 manual entry | external | OWNER |
| **METRIC-17** | Age demographics | is the 4th bucket **60+** or **unknown**? | 1 60+ · 2 unknown · 3 five buckets | `user_profiles.date_of_birth` | OWNER |
| **METRIC-18** | Impressions | **which impression** — store-listing, marketing, or in-app? | 1 in-app · 2 store-listing · 3 marketing · 4 `A11` empty | none | OWNER — **see note ②** |

**① `METRIC-06b` — the decomposition is already ruled.** Direction **`I`** (ledger `:12344`): *"Admin must
distinguish **gross coaching revenue · platform commission · net/platform revenue**. `marketplace_commission_rate`
(0.10) is the commission input. **Calculation and source definitions must be explicit before implementation;
no monetary value is fabricated.**"* So **option 1 is the recorded direction**; what remains is the
calculation definition the direction itself demands. `COWORK` §8 forbids an agent inventing it.

**② `METRIC-18` — the term is already defined.** Direction **`K`** (ledger `:12345`): impressions are
***"eligible content renders/views, held distinct from reach · unique viewers · clicks · engagement ·
sessions"***. That **supersedes** the earlier reconciliation line (`:12134`) saying *"the term appears in no
V5 source"*, which predates it. **So option 1 is the recorded definition**; what blocks `METRIC-18` is a
**producer** — no impression event exists — not its meaning.

**The four cards needing no decision remain intact and their producers are live**, verified this run:
Total users → `admin_user_overview` · Recent admin activity → `admin_audit_events` · Security →
`admin_security_events` · AI Guardian (read-only) → `governance_policy` + `guardian_state`.

### `METRIC-19` *(new, from the design package's own boundary list)*

**`BOUNDARIES B`** — the build spec names a **Notifications Overview** group; **no corresponding area exists
on the approved Dashboard, and `Notifications` is not one of the 17 matrix areas.** The requirement is kept,
placement is not decided. **Not previously in my record.**
**OPTIONS** — 1 place it under Operations · 2 place it on the Dashboard · 3 confirm it is out of scope for V1.
**STATUS — OWNER.**

---

## C · OWNER DECISIONS — CAP-1 vocabulary

### `CAP-1-REASON`

**FACTS.** 170 ships `moderation_reason` and `content_reports.reason` as **free text**. I searched the
governing record for a reason-code vocabulary: **none exists.** The only near-hit is `PD-A06`, which is about
the planning engine and unrelated.

**EXACT QUESTION.** Should moderation and report reasons be a **fixed vocabulary**, and if so, what are the
exact values?

**OPTIONS** — 1 keep free text · 2 fixed list (**the values must come from you**) · 3 fixed list with a free-text
"other".

**SECURITY NOTE.** The reason is written by staff about a member. 170 deliberately keeps it **out of the audit
delta** for that reason; only the state transition is recorded.

**NO RECOMMENDATION — the governing record contains none, and inventing categories is what §141/§142
established must not be done. STATUS — OWNER.**

### `CAP-1-APPEAL`

**FACTS.** I re-checked whether any source now opens appeals. The only mention anywhere is
`QA_CORRECTION_RIGHTS_EXHAUSTION_REPORT:247`, recording that *"no correction/appeal workflow exists"* for
coach-authored records — **a finding that none exists, not an authorization to build one.**

**STATUS — DEFERRED, unchanged. No appeal workflow was designed.**

---

## D · PHASE GATE

**`P7`** — gated. Guardian **Manage** is operational (169); **Approve** is non-operational pending the action
queue, which `P7` supplies. The three-leg proof is preserved and runs every suite: the grant still answers, no
write path is gated on it, the resource is unmoved. **No approval queue was invented.**

---

## E · INFRASTRUCTURE BLOCKER

**`QA_DB_URL`** — a CI secret, absent here. Blocks `FG-1`, `FG-2` and **ENV-3's live half**. All three are
SQL rather than REST, and `live-evidence.sh` is written to skip without it.

**The static half is verified and passes every run**: `check-migration-manifest.mjs` confirms all 171
migrations declared, 000–170, manifest and ledger agreeing. **Nothing was fabricated to stand in for the live
comparison.**

---

## F · NO NEW EXECUTABLE WORK

One disciplined frontier sweep was run. **No independently executable authorized work was found**, and none
was manufactured: no migration was created to advance the number, no matrix entry altered, no placeholder UI
or design artifact produced.

---

## G · RECOMMENDED ORDER OF RESOLUTION

| # | input | unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`DESIGN-02`** component specs *(or a ruling that the six screens suffice)* | the largest `P5` surface — ≈27 unimplemented components |
| 2 | **`METRIC-12`** severity | the attention queue, and resolves two authorities disagreeing in shipped code |
| 3 | **`METRIC-06a` + `06b`** revenue | the highest-value card; the decomposition is already ruled, only the calculation is owed |
| 4 | **`DESIGN-01`** two state frames | `critical-incident` now; `Guardian-approval-required` pairs with `P7` |
| 5 | the remaining eight metric IDs | one card each, independent of each other |
| 6 | **`CAP-1-REASON`** | a vocabulary refinement; moderation already works without it |
| 7 | **`QA_DB_URL`** | moves ENV-3 to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` |

---

## H · RESPONSE SHEET

# PART II · 12CIRCLE+ WEBSITE WORKSTREAM — separate from the V5 implementation above

> **Everything above this line is the EXISTING V5 IMPLEMENTATION package and is unchanged.**
> This part exists only on branch `workstream/12c-plus-website`. Website blockers do not block V5,
> and V5 blockers block the website only where named below.

**Status (owner direction 2026-10-07, [`docs/website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_OWNER_DIRECTION.md`](website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_OWNER_DIRECTION.md)):**

| Track | Status |
|---|---|
| Discovery | COMPLETE |
| Architecture | RECOMMENDATION PREPARED (WEB-OD-02 open; not approved) |
| Design | CLAUDE DESIGN IN PROGRESS (WEB-OD-05 assigned) |
| Implementation | WAITING FOR APPROVED DESIGN / AUTHORITY |
| Domain | UNRESOLVED (WEB-OD-03, tied to PD-F04) |
| Hosting | UNRESOLVED |
| Backend | NOT REQUIRED by the current recommendation |
| Legal / support pages | REQUIRED FOR RELEASE; content authority still required |

WEB-OD-01 is settled: a public 12Circle+ website exists, with the broader scope Claude Design is designing. The four
legal and support pages are minimum release infrastructure, not the whole site. No website code exists. Nothing is deployed.

- Owner direction and status: [`docs/website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_OWNER_DIRECTION.md`](website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_OWNER_DIRECTION.md)
- Discovery baseline A–P: [`docs/website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_WORKSTREAM_ASSESSMENT.md`](website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_WORKSTREAM_ASSESSMENT.md)
- Decisions: [`docs/website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_DECISION_PACKAGE.md`](website/12CIRCLE_PLUS_WEBSITE_DECISION_PACKAGE.md). Open decisions are re-batched into one package after the Claude Design package is reconciled.
