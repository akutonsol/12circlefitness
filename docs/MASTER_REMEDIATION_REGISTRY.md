# 12 Circle Fitness — Master Remediation Registry

**Wave 0 deliverable. The canonical finding ledger for the whole programme.**

## 0. What this reconciliation did

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Reports read in full | `MASTER_QA_RECONCILIATION`, `REMEDIATION_EXECUTION_PLAN`, `PHASE_1_SECURITY_AUDIT`, `PHASE_2_WORKOUT_RECONCILIATION`, `WORKOUT_DOMAIN_CONTRACT`, `PHASE_2_WORKOUT_TEST_MATRIX`, `qa-environments`, and workstreams **A–N** (14 reports, ~11 000 lines) |
| Raw finding records ingested | **428** |
| Aliases collapsed | **118** |
| Canonical findings | **310** |
| Independently re-verified this session | 14 claims (§0.2) |
| Code changed | **none** |
| Migrations written | **none** |
| Environments contacted | **none** — no QA or production request was issued |

### 0.1 Evidence classes (used in every row)

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **LIVE** | Reproduced against QA with a real request by the owning workstream |
| **SRC-V** | Proven from source **and re-verified in this session** against the current tree |
| **SRC** | Proven from source by the owning workstream; not re-derived here |
| **RPT** | Carried on the owning workstream's live reproduction |
| **OPEN** | Suspected; needs a probe or a decision before it can be classified |
| **UNVERIFIABLE** | Depends on production or on dashboard state that was deliberately not inspected |

### 0.2 Claims re-verified in this session

Fourteen load-bearing claims were re-derived against the current working tree, because
they gate the whole plan and the tree has moved under several workstreams.

| Claim | Source | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 20 migrations untracked, incl. 113–122 | LRE-03 | **CONFIRMED** — `git status` shows 20 `??`, `000` and `104`–`122` |
| 15 historical migrations edited in place | LRE-04 | **CONFIRMED** — 15 ` M`, list matches exactly |
| `APP_ENV` defaults to `prod` | LRE-01 / REL-07 | **CONFIRMED** — `app_env.dart:151` |
| Three Dart harnesses hardcode the production ref | LRE-02 / REL-18 / K-ENV-1 | **CONFIRMED** — `tool/live_integration_test.dart:15`, `qa_self_guided.dart:22`, `qa_entitlements.dart:27` |
| No CI beyond a production keep-alive ping | LRE-05 / N-01 | **CONFIRMED** — `.github/workflows/` holds one file |
| `materialize_program_week` lost its authorization guard | F-J-01 | **CONFIRMED** — 116 built a `can_act_on_program` wrapper over `*_engine`; `119:403` re-creates the public name as a bare `SECURITY DEFINER` body and `119:483` re-grants it to `authenticated`; `122` repins `search_path` by `ALTER FUNCTION` only and **does not restore the guard** |
| `derive_parq_risk` throws on the three literal flag appends | F-J-17 | **CONFIRMED** — `115:142,143,145` append untyped literals to a `text[]`; the indexed append at `:140` is typed and safe, so only pregnancy / postpartum / active-injury writes fail |
| `build_workout` throws whenever recovery < 60 | F-J-07 | **CONFIRMED** — `089:51` declares `rules text[]`; `089:55` appends the untyped literal `'RECOVERY_REDUCTION'` |
| Workout completion swallows persistence and celebrates anyway | EC-05 / N-07 | **CONFIRMED** — `active_workout_screen.dart:608` awaits `logWorkout` unguarded, `:611-619` wraps `completeSession` in `catch (_) {}` |
| `public.checkins` is created by no migration | CON-01 / I-CHK-01 / E-CHK-01 / M-02 | **CONFIRMED** — only `weekly_checkins` exists (`000:146`); `checkin_service.dart` and `coach_dashboard_screen.dart` both read `checkins` |
| Every A–N report is itself untracked | new | **CONFIRMED, and undercounted** — `docs/` held **29** untracked files, not 18. W1-T1 established that the whole untracked set is **96 files, not 62**: `git status` collapses a wholly-untracked directory into one entry, so `supabase/tests/` (25 files, every live security and AI probe) counted as a single item. All 96 are now tracked |
| Schema-contract guard exists and is wired | I | **CONFIRMED** — `npm run test:contract`, `supabase/tests/contract/known-violations.json` carries 2 relations + 8 columns |
| Live security / AI suites exist and are unwired | Phase 1, J, N | **CONFIRMED** — `supabase/tests/security/` (6 suites), `supabase/tests/ai/` (5 suites); neither runs in CI |
| Current mobile baseline | N (699) | **RE-MEASURED: 730 passed, 9 skipped, 0 failed** — the tree moved again after N |

**One correction to the reports, arising from this re-measurement:** every count quoted
in a workstream report (514 / 591 / 623 / 667 / 690 / 699 / 730) is a snapshot of a tree
that several sessions were writing to concurrently. **730/9/0 is the Wave 0 baseline.**
No count below 730 should be treated as a regression signal.

## 1. Canonical root-cause model

Prior workstreams produced five overlapping numbering schemes (`RC-1…RC-8` in the master
reconciliation, `RC-A…RC-D` in Phase 2, `C-1/C-2` in B, `RC-H1…RC-H5` in H, and
`RC-5/7/8/3/4/9/10/11/12` in I). They are **not** reconcilable by renumbering, because
several describe the same defect at different altitudes. The model below is canonical.
**Every prior ID maps into it; no prior ID survives as a tracking key.**

| ID | Root cause | Statement | Supersedes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CRC-01** | **Schema-contract drift** | The application names relations and columns the database does not have. PostgREST validates the select list **before** authorization, so the answer is `400 / 42703` — never a permission error — and every call site converts it to an empty value. A typo is indistinguishable from a feature that was never built. | RC-H2; part of RC-5, RC-7 |
| **CRC-02** | **Undeclared payload contracts** | A payload or vocabulary crosses a boundary with no schema, no CHECK and no validator, and its writers and readers disagree. | RC-5, RC-A |
| **CRC-03** | **Failure returned as a legitimate value** | Two mechanically distinct halves. **C-1:** a thrown failure is caught and converted to `[]`/`null`/`false`/`0`/`{}`. **C-2:** no exception is ever thrown — PostgREST answers an RLS-filtered or id-missed write with **200 and zero rows**, so `await update(...); return true;` reports a write that never happened. | RC-7, RC-C |
| **CRC-04** | **Fabricated success** | Distinct from CRC-03: the fallback returns **fiction**, not emptiness — a ticket code for a row that was never written, invented coach messages, invented habit streaks, a fabricated `risk_level`, a synthetic `pending` check-in, a stated £0.00 balance. | RC-9, RC-H1 |
| **CRC-05** | **Degraded safety input, decision proceeds** | An input that constrains a safety decision fails to load, silently becomes the empty set, and the decision is made anyway — then recorded as a valid trace with a confidence score computed from the same emptied arrays. | new (B rule **S**) |
| **CRC-06** | **Human-readable label as authoritative identity** | A name, title or display code is used where a stable id belongs; or an identity model lives in application convention (check-then-insert) instead of in a UNIQUE index. | RC-6, RC-10, RC-B |
| **CRC-07** | **Default-open privilege, and controls applied by sweep** | Postgres and Supabase defaults grant broadly; migrations revoke `PUBLIC` only. Worse: a control applied by a **sweep** rather than at the point of definition is silently dropped by the next `CREATE OR REPLACE` — this has now happened to `search_path` (twice) **and to an authorization wrapper**. | RC-1, RC-3 |
| **CRC-08** | **Caller-supplied identity trusted** | A subject uuid, a `target_client_id`, a role claim or an empty-string bearer comparison decides whose data is read or written. | RC-4 |
| **CRC-09** | **Cross-user aggregate over per-user RLS** | A count, capacity or roster is computed by a client query against a table whose policy scopes rows to the caller. The query is not denied — it is **narrowed**, and a silently narrowed result is indistinguishable from a real one. | RC-11 |
| **CRC-10** | **Presentation shipped ahead of its write path** | Tabs with no data source, toggles with no consumer, screens with no route, engine functions with no caller, columns with no writer. No error is ever produced, because no call is ever made. | RC-H4 |
| **CRC-11** | **Two systems for one concept** | The newer, server-authoritative implementation was built and the older one was left running beside it. | RC-H5 |
| **CRC-12** | **Naive local time into `timestamptz`** | `DateTime.now().toIso8601String()` renders local time with no zone marker; Postgres reads it as UTC. Day-window reads are skewed in both directions. | RC-8 |
| **CRC-13** | **No mechanical gate** | Nothing automated watches the repository. No CI, no migration ledger, no artifact provenance, no rollback, no observability. **This is why every other root cause survived to be discovered by audit rather than by a red build.** | new (L, N) |
| **CRC-14** | **Fixtures and guards aimed at the wrong layer** | QA fixtures written against readers rather than the writer; 259 tests that execute a copy of the product; four guards written for a specific defect that cannot detect it because the defect moved one layer away. | RC-12 |

### 1.1 Dominance

| Root cause | Canonical findings | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| CRC-03 Failure as value | 61 | 20% |
| CRC-13 No mechanical gate | 44 | 14% |
| CRC-10 Presentation ahead of write path | 38 | 12% |
| CRC-01 Schema-contract drift | 29 | 9% |
| CRC-07 Default-open / sweep-applied control | 24 | 8% |
| CRC-04 Fabricated success | 19 | 6% |
| CRC-11 Two systems for one concept | 18 | 6% |
| CRC-06 Label as identity | 17 | 5% |
| CRC-05 Degraded safety input | 15 | 5% |
| CRC-08 Caller-supplied identity | 14 | 5% |
| CRC-02 Undeclared payload contract | 13 | 4% |
| CRC-14 Guards at the wrong layer | 11 | 4% |
| CRC-12 Naive timestamps | 4 | 1% |
| CRC-09 Aggregate over per-user RLS | 3 | 1% |

**The single most important structural statement in this document:** CRC-13 is not
merely the largest cluster after the error contract — it is the **enabler of all the
others.** Phase 1 and Phase 2 closed 24 findings correctly and both were then partially
undone by a later migration that nothing was watching (§4). Until Wave 1 lands, every
remediation in this programme has the same half-life.

## 2. Canonical statuses

| Status | Meaning | Evidence required to enter it |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCOVERED` | Recorded, not yet triaged into a wave | a source report |
| `DUPLICATE` | Collapsed into a canonical ID | the alias map, §3 |
| `ALREADY_FIXED` | Closed before this reconciliation | see the evidence-state ladder in `QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md` |
| `FIX_IN_PROGRESS` | A named owner is mid-change in this tree | a working-tree diff |
| `BLOCKED_DECISION` | Cannot be built without product/business/clinical authority | a decision ID in `MASTER_PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` |
| `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` | Cannot be built or verified until an environment exists | an environment blocker ID, §8 |
| `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` | No blocker; assigned to a wave | a wave ID |
| `REMEDIATED` | Code/migration changed; not yet retested | FIXED IN CODE |
| `RETEST_REQUIRED` | Applied to QA; live assertion outstanding | FIXED ON QA |
| `VERIFIED_CLOSED` | Every required evidence state present | VERIFIED LIVE **and** VERIFIED IN CI |
| `DEFERRED` | Deliberately out of scope for this programme, with an owner and a date |
| `RELEASE_BLOCKER` | Not a code defect here; blocks a named release gate |

**As written at Wave 0, nothing in this registry was `VERIFIED_CLOSED`** — fifty-two
findings were `ALREADY_FIXED`, a weaker state, because the live suites that proved them
had not been re-run since the tree moved, and two of them were subsequently regressed.
**Update 2026-08-26 (§7.8):** Wave 1 put the suites in CI, and the green run at commit
`6d42b10` (271/271 live security across six suites) supplied the missing VERIFIED LIVE +
VERIFIED IN CI states. **23 rows are now `VERIFIED_CLOSED`** — exactly those whose class
evidence is fully present; every exclusion and its missing evidence is recorded in §7.8.

### 3.1 Findings the reports **contradict each other** on — resolved here

| Item | Disagreement | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `/checkins` route | Master reconciliation called it "a working check-in screen, orphaned". Workstream E found it is an **appointments calendar** that queries `coaching_calls`, reached from two entry points | **E is correct.** The master reading was wrong. The genuinely orphaned code is the *service layer* — `submitWeeklyCheckin` and ten sibling symbols have zero callers. Recorded as **E-CHK-05** + **E-CHK-02**, and the master's phrasing is retired |
| `ai_adjust_nutrition` "incorrect schema reference" | Reported three times, **not reproduced** three times | **NOT REPRODUCED — closed as a false positive.** `weekly_checkins.weight_kg` and `created_at` both exist. The real defect of that shape is `I-NUT-01` (`ai-coaching-engine`), and a *second* one is `I-NUT-02` (`user_profiles.goal` inside the same function). Do not re-open the original phrasing |
| `weekly_checkins` RLS | Phase 1 marked D-03 closed; E flagged that the closure was inferred, not probed | **E is right to flag it.** 114+118 are source-correct and `d03` asserts 27/27 — but that suite has not run since. Status stays `ALREADY_FIXED`, **not** `VERIFIED_CLOSED`, pending Wave 1's CI |
| `dietary_restrictions` column type | Code comment asserts `text[]`; QA probe says `text` | QA is `text`. **Production is unverified and must be confirmed before rollout** (Q-6). The forward migration must converge from either starting type |
| K-04 reproduction payload | K published a repro including `ticket_code` | **H is correct:** `ticket_code` does not exist, so K's payload fails rather than succeeds. Drop that field from the repro. The vulnerability is real; the published proof was wrong |
| Test baseline | 514 / 591 / 623 / 667 / 690 / 699 quoted across reports | All are snapshots of a concurrently-edited tree. **730 passed / 9 skipped / 0 failed** is the Wave 0 baseline, measured this session |

---

## 4. Already fixed, regressed, and not reproduced

### 4.1 `ALREADY_FIXED` — 52 findings. Do not re-open.

> **2026-08-26:** 13 of these rows (SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03, SEC-05, SEC-06, SEC-07,
> SEC-10, F-01, F-03, F-05, F-06, F-07, F-08) are promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` on the
> live CI evidence at `6d42b10` — see **§7.8** for the promotion record, the rows that
> deliberately stay, and each row's remaining evidence gap. The tables below are the
> historical Wave 0 record and are not rewritten.
>
> **2026-08-25:** two further rows — **SEC-11** and **OBS-4** — are promoted on the live
> SQL evidence at `2a8d0b6`. **SEC-09 is not promoted**: FG-1 returned 5 PASS / 0 FAIL
> live, but the owner ruling of 2026-08-25 reads §7.8's "needs FG-1 + I-MIG-03" as
> requiring I-MIG-03 itself to reach `VERIFIED_CLOSED`, which it has not. SEC-09 stays
> `ALREADY_FIXED`. See **§7.9**, which records the ruling and why the remaining Phase 2
> rows deliberately stay.

**Phase 1 (security), closed by migrations 113–118 — evidence: 270/270 live assertions**

| Finding | What closed it |
|---|---|
| SEC-01 / D-01 · `coach_client_relationships` had no RLS | 113 — RLS + asymmetric activation model + `enforce_relationship_integrity` |
| SEC-02 / D-02 · role self-escalation | 115 — `enforce_profile_privilege` trigger pins 7 privilege columns; role vocabulary CHECK; `admin_set_user_role()` |
| SEC-03 / D-03 · `weekly_checkins` had no RLS | 114 — RLS + `enforce_checkin_authorship` split |
| SEC-04 / D-1D · 11 subject-scoped RPCs trusting a caller uuid | 116 — `can_act_for` / `can_act_on_program`; 13 engine functions renamed `*_engine` behind authorized wrappers |
| SEC-05 · `anon` could execute 98 of 100 functions | 116 — schema-wide `REVOKE` + a 50-name allowlist |
| SEC-06 / SEC-07 · AI and MIE substrate tables had no RLS | 117 |
| SEC-09 · 73 definer functions with a mutable `search_path` | 116 + 118 → 0 |
| SEC-10 / D-05 / F-04 · `coach_availability` `USING (true)` to PUBLIC | 118 |
| SEC-11 / D-06 / R-02 · client could rewrite a completed session | 120 — `workout_set_logs_protect_history`, `workout_sessions_terminal_status` |
| Q-4 client-computed PAR-Q risk | 115 — `derive_parq_risk` + `apply_parq_risk` made the classification server-authoritative ⚠ *see §4.2* |
| F-01 · `coach_client_workout_stats` unscoped view | 118 |
| F-03 · `notifications` INSERT `WITH CHECK (true)` | 118 + `may_notify()` |
| F-05, F-06, F-07, F-08 · blanket policies, no-`TO` policies, anon grants, invoker search_path | 118 |
| SEC-08 / F-02 / Q-2 · `public.workouts` had no RLS | 118 — made a read-only catalog rather than dropped, so retirement stays an open data-model decision |

**Phase 2 (workout contract), closed by 119–121 — evidence: 20/20 live assertions + 129 behavioural tests**

| Finding | What closed it |
|---|---|
| WRK-01 / WKA-01 · two live set-identity keys | 120 retires 051's ordinal unique index; `(session_id, set_id)` is the only key |
| WRK-02 / WKA-02 · swap inherits set identities → 23505 | `WorkoutExercise.replacedBy` mints fresh identities; uniqueness moved to workout scope |
| WRK-03/04/05 / WKA-03 · untyped `program_workouts.exercises`; String reps; 0 kg; lost rest | 119 — canonical prescription contract, canonicalizing trigger, `CHECK`, `weight_kg` nullable with `null ≠ 0` |
| WRK-06 · engine materialized no prescription | 119 — `materialize_program_week` emits `weight_kg: null` and **raises** rather than writing an empty workout |
| WRK-07 · workout providers returned `[]` on error | Phase 2 — `workout_provider.dart` now contains no `catch`; pinned by `EC-G1` ⚠ *the swallow moved down a layer — EC-11* |

### 4.2 ⚠ `REGRESSION` — closed work that a later change undid. **Five findings. This is the most important section of this document.**

Every one of these was introduced by a *correct* later change that nobody was watching.
They are the direct, measurable cost of CRC-13.

| ID | What regressed | Introduced by | Mechanism | Sev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-J-01** | SEC-04's authorization guard on `materialize_program_week` | migration **119** | 116 renamed the engine body to `*_engine` and published a `can_act_on_program` wrapper under the public name. `119:403` re-created the public name as a **bare `SECURITY DEFINER` body** and `119:483` re-granted `EXECUTE` to `authenticated`. `122` repinned `search_path` with `ALTER FUNCTION` and never touched the body. **116's own header warned about exactly this escape.** Live: an unrelated authenticated client reaches the engine against another coach's program; with a real week number it `DELETE`s and rewrites that week's `program_workouts` | **P0** |
| **F-J-17** | Phase 1's PAR-Q server-authority fix (Q-4 / SEC-023) | migration **115** itself | `derive_parq_risk` appends three flags as **untyped literals** to a `text[]`. Postgres resolves `anyarray \|\| anyarray` and fails with `22P02 malformed array literal`. `apply_parq_risk` is a `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` trigger, so the throw rejects the whole profile write. **A member cannot declare an injury, a pregnancy or a postpartum state.** The fix that made risk server-authoritative made risk unrecordable | **P0** |
| **F-J-07** | `build_workout`'s under-recovery rule | migration **089** (pre-existing, surfaced by J) | Identical shape. `recovery = 60` returns 200; `recovery = 59` returns `22P02`. **The single rule that protects an under-recovered member is the only rule in the function that cannot run** | **P0** |
| **EC-05 / N-07** | WKA-04 (orphaned `in_progress` session), closed by Phase 2 through the happy path | pre-existing error path, unchanged by Phase 2 | `active_workout_screen.dart:611-619` wraps `completeSession` in `catch (_) {}` and shows the celebration regardless; `:608` awaits `logWorkout`, whose whole body is `catch (_) {}`. The session stays `in_progress`, the Resume banner keeps offering a finished workout, and `workout_sessions_one_active_per_user` then constrains the next one. `EC-G1` passes because it does not read this file | **P1** |
| **EC-11** | WRK-07 (provider-layer swallow), closed by Phase 2 | pre-existing service layer | The swallow **moved down a layer rather than away**. `WorkoutService` holds 13 swallow sites; nine providers Phase 2 did not name are thin wrappers over them and are therefore error-blind by construction. `getCompletionRate() → 0` is a **fabricated** adherence figure shown to a coach | **P1** |

**The class fix, and it is mandatory:** a standing test asserting that no function
carrying an authorization wrapper, a `search_path` pin or a security trigger may be
redefined by a later migration without carrying them forward. `SEC-027` already does
exactly this for one function (`generate_client_plan` / `plan_day_titles`) and is the
strongest guard in the tree. Generalise it. **Tracked as `I-MIG-03` and scheduled in
Wave 2; it is the only reason to believe the next Phase-1-equivalent will hold.**

### 4.3 `NOT_REPRODUCED` — closed as false positives

| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `ai_adjust_nutrition` references an incorrect schema | **Not reproduced, three times independently.** Both columns exist. The real instances are I-NUT-01 and I-NUT-02 |
| `resumePosition` is corrupt | **Not a defect in itself.** Its inputs were — a stale cursor after a swap now misses cleanly (RC-B, closed) |
| A working `/checkins` screen exists but is orphaned | **Materially wrong** — see §3.1 |
| Migration 076's `created_at` schema defect | **Already corrected in the working tree** (`B2-6`). ⚠ *the correction is an in-place edit and does not self-apply — LRE-04* |
| Cross-tenant read/write in nutrition or check-in | **Not reproduced anywhere.** The one reachable subject-uuid surface (`ai-coach`'s `target_client_id`) fails **closed** |

## 5. Reconciliation summary — required table

Canonical findings only. Aliases excluded. `Fixed` counts §4.1 entries attributed to that
domain; the five §4.2 regressions are counted as **open**, in their domain, at their
current severity.

| Domain | Findings | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | Fixed | Blocked | Ready | Release blocker |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| **Total** | **310** | **42** | **111** | **121** | **63** | **52** | **71** | **257** | **56** |

*Reading notes.* `Fixed` (52) and `Ready`/`Blocked` overlap by design: a fixed finding is
neither ready nor blocked, so `Ready + Blocked + Fixed` ≈ 380 > 310 because 70 findings
are counted in both `Blocked` and `Ready` — they are ready in part and blocked in part
(typically a mechanical half plus a decision-gated half). Every such split is stated in
the finding's own row. `Release blocker` is a **gate attachment**, not a severity: a P3
that blocks App Review is still a release blocker.

**Severity is assigned by impact, not by gate.** Where this registry departs from a
source report's rating, the deviation is recorded in the row. The two systematic
departures are: (a) Workstream G's iOS **build** blockers are rated P1 here, not P0 —
they block Gate 3 and nothing else, and rating them P0 alongside "AI prescribes without
knowing the injuries" destroys the meaning of the scale; (b) three findings rated P1 by
their owning workstream are raised to **P0** because a later workstream proved a safety
consequence (F-J-17, F-J-07, I-INT-02).

Forty-two findings. Each is stated with the complete field set required by the
programme brief. **These are the findings that gate the plan.**

### SEC-R1 · `materialize_program_week` lost its authorization guard
`F-J-01` · **P0** · ✅ `VERIFIED_CLOSED` 2026-08-27 *(migration 124 restored the wrapper; `d04` §8 asserts the 116 class read from migration source with `KNOWN_OPEN` empty — `materialize_program_week` probed, not exempted; `j04`-04C 403s an unrelated caller against a **real** foreign-owned program; FG-1 SP-4/SP-5 prove the redefinition preserved the `search_path` pin and the grant posture. CI run #27 at `388b5c1` — see §7.10. **Owner ruling 2026-08-27: §5.1 does not apply to F-J-01; it is governed as an authorization/security finding under SEC-R1.**)* · Wave 2

| **Security impact** | Any authenticated account reaches a `SECURITY DEFINER` engine body against **any** coach's program. With a real week number the call `DELETE`s and rewrites that week's `program_workouts`. All four sibling functions correctly return 403 — this one alone is open |
| **User impact** | A coach's programming for a real client can be destroyed and rewritten by an unrelated account |
| **Business impact** | Re-opens a P0 that Phase 1 closed and certified. Undermines the evidence value of the Phase 1 sign-off |
| **Dependencies** | None to fix. Blocks nothing, but must land before any Wave 5 engine work re-exercises this path |

| **Parallel** | **YES** — one new migration, disjoint from every other file |
| **Owner** | database / security |
| **Tests** | Extend `supabase/tests/security/d04-rpc-execution.mjs` to assert **all five** 116 wrappers as a class, not individually. Add `I-MIG-03`'s standing source guard (§4.2) so a future `CREATE OR REPLACE` cannot repeat this |

| **Evidence AFTER** | 2026-08-27, CI run **#27** (`33032108346`, head `388b5c16`, conclusion `success`). *Live security suite* green — `d04` §8: the class has five members, every member has a probe, `materialize_program_week()` **refuses an unauthorized caller**, and `materialize_program_week_engine()` is unreachable by a client. *Live AI suite* green — `j04`-04C: HTTP 403 / `42501` against a real program owned by another coach. *Live SQL evidence* green — FG-1 SP-4 2/2 re-pinned, SP-5 zero EXECUTE to PUBLIC/anon. *Static guards* green — I-MIG-03 durability guard (records mode). **Retained limitation:** the row's *Live QA* field also names the positive legs (owning coach → 200, `service_role` → 200); no suite asserts them, so an over-refusing wrapper would look identical to a correct one. Registered as evidence gap **FG-3** (§7.10), not silently closed |

### SEC-R2 · The PAR-Q classifier throws — a member cannot declare an injury or a pregnancy

| **Security impact** | None directly — it fails closed by throwing |
| **User impact** | **`PATCH user_profiles {has_injuries:true, injury_locations:'left knee'}` is rejected with `22P02`.** Onboarding intake writes exactly these columns, so an injured, pregnant or postpartum member cannot complete onboarding at all — and CON-02/EC-03 then marks them onboarded with the data discarded |
| **Business impact** | The three highest-consequence safety declarations the product collects are unrecordable |
| **Dependencies** | **Blocks** every downstream safety finding (CON-04, E-NUT-05, F-J-05) — there is no point wiring a constraint to data that cannot be written. **Must precede Wave 5** |
| **Decision** | none — the cast is a defect fix, not a policy choice |
| **Remediation** | Cast the three literals to `::text` in a forward migration; backfill rows whose flags were silently never written. Grep the whole migration set for the same `array \|\| untyped-literal` shape |
| **Parallel** | **YES** — same migration as SEC-R1/SEC-R3 |
| **Owner** | database |
| **Tests** | A live assertion per flag: pregnancy / postpartum / injury each produce the flag and a `moderate`-or-higher level. Extend `SEC-023` (which pins the Dart and SQL classifiers in step) to assert the classifier **executes** |

Owner ruling 2026-08-27 settles §5.1's test shape only (FJ17-7 is the negative test); it does not waive the fifth state. See §7.10 |

### ENV-1 · The entire remediation programme is untracked
`LRE-03` · **P0** · ✅ `VERIFIED_CLOSED` 2026-08-26 *(W1-T1 custody + migration-hygiene guard green in CI at `6d42b10`; zero untracked non-ignored engineering files)* · Wave 1

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Source** | L · re-verified **SRC-V** |
| **Root cause** | CRC-13 |
| **Layer** | repository |
| **Affected** | 20 untracked migrations (`000`, `104`–`122`) — **every Phase 1 security migration and every Phase 2 contract migration**; 22 untracked test files including all six live security suites' Dart guards; `workout_restoration.dart` and `workout_contract.dart`, both **production source the app does not compile without**; and **all 18 A–N reports** |
| **Security impact** | The complete P0 security remediation is one `git clean -fd` from non-existence. It cannot be reviewed, deployed from CI, or applied to production, because it exists nowhere but this working tree |
| **User impact** | none today |
| **Business impact** | Total loss of the programme's output on any tree accident |

### ENV-2 · 15 already-applied migrations were edited in place

| **Security impact** | 076's cross-environment cron target — the fix that stopped a QA project POSTing to **production** Edge Functions with a service-role bearer — is an in-place edit. Any environment that already ran the old 076 still has the production target |
| **User impact** | Production silently retains every defect these edits fix, including 076's `created_at`→`started_at` bug, which raises on every scheduled run once Vault is configured |
| **Business impact** | Production cannot receive the corrections at all. This is the reason the security rollout is not yet writable |
| **Dependencies** | Requires ENV-1. **Blocks** LRE-08 → the production rollout chain |
| **Decision** | none |
| **Remediation** | Enumerate the semantic delta of each of the 15 and emit **one idempotent forward migration `123`** carrying every one. Keep the in-place edits for from-empty replay; never rely on them for promotion. Master's HYG-02 flagged this for 076 only — it applies to all fifteen |
| **Parallel** | **NO** — one owner must do the delta enumeration; splitting it guarantees a missed delta |
| **Owner** | database |
| **Tests** | A guard asserting no tracked migration is modified relative to its merge-base |
| **Live QA** | Replay 123 twice against QA; no-op the second time |
| **Gate** | Gate 0 → G-04 |

### ENV-3 · Migrations 113–122 are applied to QA but absent from the migration ledger
`I-MIG-01` · **P0** · ✅ `VERIFIED_CLOSED` 2026-08-25 *(all eight amended closure criteria met; the live ledger check executed in CI at `2a8d0b6` — see §7.9)* · Wave 1

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Source** | I, A |
| **Root cause** | CRC-13 |
| **Affected** | `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` on QA stops at **112** |
| **Business impact** | QA cannot be reasoned about from its ledger. `supabase db push` would re-run all ten. **All ten were verified idempotent by I**, so a push today would be a no-op *in effect* — that is a property of how they were written, not of the process |
| **Dependencies** | Requires ENV-1 |
| **Remediation** | Insert the ten version rows into `schema_migrations` on **QA only**, after confirming the linked project is QA. Never touch production's ledger without the §9 rollout plan |
| **Parallel** | **YES**, after ENV-1 |
| **Tests** | A CI check that the ledger's max version equals the highest migration filename |
| **Live QA** | `supabase migration list --linked` shows local and remote in step |
| **Gate** | G-03 → G-09 |

**W1-T3 · QA ledger repair — executed 2026-08-25.** Owner-authorized; performed by the
product owner from the local Supabase CLI, because the orchestration session has no
network egress to the QA project and holds no QA credential (recorded at the time as
BLOCKED rather than worked around, per governance §5).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Target** | `eyqtldjqpgpljlqvpowh` — *12Circle QA*. Independently confirmed before the write from five agreeing local sources (`.temp/project-ref`, `.temp/linked-project.json`, `config.toml` `project_id`, `dart_defines/qa.json`, and `supabase/scripts/qa-db-reset.sh --check-only`), not from a variable name. Production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was **not** the target and was not contacted |
| **Operation** | `supabase migration repair --status applied 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 --linked` — a ledger write only. **No migration was executed**, no `db push` was run, and no schema object changed |
| **Observed transition** | `113`–`122`: Local-only → **Local + Remote** · `123`: Local-only → **Local-only** (unchanged). Before/after captured as `/tmp/w1t3-before.txt` and `/tmp/w1t3-after.txt`; the diff contains exactly ten changed rows, versions 113–122, and no other migration-history row changed |
| **Migration 123** | **Deliberately excluded and still unapplied.** It is committed (`24187bf`) and locally validated only. Marking it applied would cause a later `supabase db push` to skip it, so the ENV-2 forward carry would never reach any environment. No claim is made here that 123's objects exist on QA |
| **Evidence state** | FIXED ON QA · VERIFIED LIVE (the row's own *Live QA* line — `migration list --linked` now shows 113–122 in step) |
| **Why not `VERIFIED_CLOSED`** | The closure standard's release/environment class requires **VERIFIED IN CI**, and this row's own *Tests* field names the specific check — "a CI check that the ledger's max version equals the highest migration filename". **That check does not exist.** Until it does, this row stays `REMEDIATED` |
| **Open question, not resolved here** | That prescribed check, as literally worded, would be **red today by design**: the ledger's max version is `122` while the highest migration filename is `123`, precisely because 123 is committed-but-unapplied. Its predicate therefore needs an owner ruling (compare against applied-and-intended, or gate it on the pending application of 123) before it can be implemented. Recorded, not decided |

**Amendment, 2026-08-25 — the Tests field, corrected and expanded.** The original
wording above ("a CI check that the ledger's max version equals the highest
migration filename") is preserved as written and is **superseded**, not deleted.
It is a specification defect: a max cannot see a hole in the middle of the
sequence; it asserts *authored == applied*, which this programme violates by
design (102 is withheld from production, 123 is committed-but-unapplied); and it
is environment-blind, so it cannot hold for QA and production at once during any
staged rollout. Read literally it is red today for a correct reason.

`RELEASE_GATES.md` row **1.2** already states the property properly — *"every
migration **applied to QA** is recorded in `schema_migrations`"* — and row 0.9
owns migration numbering. The corrected contract is those two, made mechanical:

| Term | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| `authored` | the migration files in `supabase/migrations/` |
| `declared` | `supabase/expected_applied.json` — per environment: the applied frontier, plus deliberately `pending` / `excluded` versions, each with a reason and the gate that releases it |
| `observed` | `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, the only authority on what is applied |

**Closure of ENV-3 requires all of:**

1. authored migration inventory validation — filenames, no duplicate numbers,
   and a contiguous sequence (gate 0.9, owned by `check-migration-hygiene.sh`);
2. an environment-specific expected-state declaration in which every authored
   migration is classified and every deviation carries a reason and a gate;
3. a live comparison of `declared` against `schema_migrations`, per environment;
4. detection of **missing expected migrations** (`declared − observed`);
5. detection of **unexpected applied migrations** (`observed − declared`) — the
   signal that catches an out-of-band apply;
6. detection of **stale ledger rows** (`observed − authored`) — a row whose file
   no longer exists means history was rewritten or a migration deleted;
7. detection of **skipped migration versions** — a hole in either the authored
   sequence or the applied set below the frontier;
8. **CI execution of the live ledger check**. A check that has never run in CI
   is not a gate (closure standard §4).

**Explicitly: a committed-but-pending migration is never inserted into
`schema_migrations` to satisfy this check.** Migration 123 is declared `pending`
for QA and its ledger row is created only by its actual, separately authorized
application. Writing it early would make a later `supabase db push` skip it, and
the ENV-2 forward carry would silently never reach any environment.

**Status when this amendment was written: `REMEDIATED`.** *(Resolved 2026-08-25 — see
the closure note at the end of this row.)* Items 1, 2 and the
static half of 7 are implemented and run in CI's `static-guards` job
(`check-migration-hygiene.sh` contiguity + `supabase/scripts/check-migration-manifest.mjs`).
Items 3–6, the applied-set half of 7, and item 8 are the **live half**, which is
not implemented: it needs a QA database credential in CI, the same blocker as
FG-1 and FG-2. `VERIFIED_CLOSED` is unavailable until that half executes.

**Closure, 2026-08-25 — evidence: the live QA run at commit `2a8d0b6`.** The QA
database credential was provisioned, the live evidence phase executed, and the
ledger comparison reported **5 PASS / 0 FAIL** against QA `eyqtldjqpgpljlqvpowh`:

| Criterion | Evidence |
|---|---|
| 1 · authored inventory (filenames, duplicates, contiguity) | `check-migration-hygiene.sh`, green in `static-guards` |
| 2 · environment-specific declaration, every migration classified | `supabase/expected_applied.json` + `check-migration-manifest.mjs`, green in `static-guards` |
| 3 · live comparison of declared vs `schema_migrations` | executed in CI at `2a8d0b6` |
| 4 · missing expected migrations | **L-1 = 0** |
| 5 · unexpected applied migrations | **L-2 = 0** |
| 6 · stale ledger rows | **L-3 = 0** |
| 7 · skipped versions | authored half: hygiene contiguity 000–123 · applied half: **L-4 = 0** holes in 000–122 |
| 8 · CI execution of the live check | the run itself |

L-5 read "ledger rows 123 vs declared expected 123" — that is **123 rows**
(versions 000–122 inclusive), not migration 123. The checker separately printed
`INFO authored and PENDING for qa (declared, not applied): 123`.

**Verified QA migration state: 000–122 applied; 123 authored, committed and
declared pending — not applied, and not present as an applied ledger row.**
Migration 123 was **not** applied at this checkpoint, no `db push` was run, and
nothing was written to `schema_migrations`. **Production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc`
was not contacted.**

`ENG-15` (= F-J-15, M-01, ENV-01) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` · Wave 5

All 19 functions return `404 NOT_FOUND` (**LIVE**, three workstreams). Every AI surface,
every payment path, invites and enrichment are dead on QA. `supabase secrets list`
returns `{"secrets":[]}`. **Deliberately not remediated before Wave 5:** deploying now
converts a visibly dead system into an invisibly wrong one, because every input defect
below (CRC-01, CRC-05) currently produces confident output with no error anywhere.
Sequencing per Workstream D §6 and J §11. **Gate:** Gate 2 · **Decision:** D-8 (spend cap), D-2 (nutrition backend).

### ENV-8 · The NestJS API has no deployment target in any environment
`LRE-06` (= REL-23, M B-2) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 1/5

No Dockerfile, compose file, `fly.toml`, `vercel.json`, `render.yaml` or Terraform
anywhere. `API_BASE_URL` is empty in `qa.json`, `prod.json` **and** the prod default
table. The AI Nutrition Coach — the flagship AI surface, and the best-tested layer in
the repository — is non-functional in every buildable environment, and the Anthropic
key's only sanctioned home is a process that runs nowhere. **Blocked on D-2** (platform,
cost, and whether the parallel Firebase/passport auth stack stays). **Gate:** G-06.

### ENV-9 · No database rollback path
`LRE-08` (= REL-22) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 1

Zero down migrations across 123 files; no documented or rehearsed restore; free tier
implies no PITR. The security rollout — the highest-value change pending — is a one-way
door, and migration 102's own header documents that it breaks older clients on the way
in. **Blocked on D-3** (pay for PITR, or accept forward-only). **Gate:** G-08 → G-09.

`build.gradle.kts:32` — `signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("debug")`, Flutter's
scaffold TODO still above it. If a debug-signed build ever reached a distribution
channel the signing identity is a well-known key that cannot be rotated; the app would
have to be republished under a new package name. **Gate:** G-07.

### ENV-11 · Production carries the unpatched P0 security defects
`REL-21` · **P0** · `RELEASE_BLOCKER` · Wave 1 output, Wave 10 execution

SEC-01…SEC-05 are properties of the migration source and are therefore live in
production. 113–122 close them **on QA only**. Compounding: by migration 083's own
header, `083/084/086/087/090/091/097/099` were *never applied in any environment* before
their in-place correction — so production probably has **no content pipeline, no
certification view, no `exercise_intelligence` table and no per-attribute review**. That
is the largest single schema divergence in the product. **No production rollout, and no
production-pointed build, until ENV-1→ENV-2→ENV-9→ENV-3 are closed.** Production was not
contacted; every statement here is **UNVERIFIABLE** and derived from source.

### DAT-1 · `public.checkins` does not exist; the entire check-in feature is non-functional
`I-CHK-01` (= CON-01, EC-10, E-CHK-01, M-02) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 4

| Field | Value |

| **Source** | Master (LIVE), B, E, I, M · re-verified **SRC-V** |
| **Root cause** | CRC-01, masked by CRC-03 |
| **Affected** | `checkin_service.dart` (6 call sites), `coach_dashboard_screen.dart:108`, `qa_suites.dart:807` |
| **Impact** | Not "some check-ins fail" — **no check-in can be created by the application at all.** The coach review queue, compliance scoring, the at-risk roster, the Insights panel, the AI coach's grounding packet, the check-in component of the 12 Circle Score and the nutrition auto-adjustment all consume a structurally empty input. `hasCheckedInThisWeek()` is permanently `false`; `getCheckinStreak()` permanently `0`. The **correct** writer, `WeeklyCheckinService.submitWeeklyCheckin()`, has **zero callers** (E-CHK-02) |
| **Compounding** | `weekly_checkins` carries two mutually exclusive column families (I-CHK-03) — the one writer uses the baseline set, four readers including two AI paths use the 001 set. **Repointing the write path today would still produce NULLs on every reader**, and the AI prompt would receive the literal string `undefined` |
| **Dependencies** | **Blocked on Q-1 and Q-2.** I-CHK-03 (column contract) must land **before** I-CHK-01 (rewire) |
| **Remediation** | Per Q-1's recommendation: retire `CheckinService`, migrate callers to `weekly_checkins`. Then the column family, then the form fields (weight — Q-3), then delete the orphans, then let read failures surface |

### DAT-2 · `ai-generate-workout` loses the user's injury data
`I-INT-02` (= F-J-02, EC-02) · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` (column half) / `BLOCKED_DECISION` (fail-closed half) · Wave 3/5

Selects `user_profiles.goal, equipment` — **neither column exists** — so the whole query
400s and the generator loses `has_injuries`, `injury_locations`, `experience_level` and
`training_location` **in the same failed request**. `{ data: null }` is returned without
throwing and `?? 'general'` / `?? {}` turns a hard schema error into a confident default.
**Every AI workout is generated for a "general"-goal, "Bodyweight"-equipped,
"intermediate" gym trainee with no injuries, whoever the member actually is** — while the
system prompt instructs the model to *"AVOID anything contraindicated by their injuries."*
Column fix: one line, no decision. **Fail-closed behaviour is Q-5 / rule S.**
**Tests:** stub the read to error → 502 and **no workout**; stub it to `[]` → a workout
*is* generated (proves rule S did not over-trigger). **Gate:** Gate 1.

---

### DAT-3 · `ai-coaching-engine`'s profile query 400s entirely
`I-INT-01` (= F-J-02) · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 3

Same mechanism, `user_profiles.goal`. One-line fix (`fitness_goal`). Already recorded in
`known-violations.json`; removing the entry is the last step of the fix and the guard
fails if either half is done alone.

---

### DAT-4 · Event registration writes a nonexistent column, then fabricates a ticket
`I-COM-01` (= H-02, M-04) · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 3

`event_registrations.ticket_code` does not exist (the column is `qr_code`); the write
400s and a **"Demo fallback"** `catch` issues a ticket code for a row that was never
written. The user holds a ticket for an event they are not registered for. **Fix
together with `K-04`** — same table, different layer: K-04 is the missing `WITH CHECK`
that lets a member self-grant a *paid* ticket, this is the column name that makes *free*
registration fabricate one. **Drop `ticket_code` from K-04's published repro payload** —
it makes that request fail rather than succeed.

---

### DAT-5 · The coach check-in notification can never fire
`I-CHK-02` · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 4

`trg_notify_coach_on_checkin` (004) returns early unless `weekly_checkins.coach_id` is
set. **No writer in the tree sets it**, so the trigger has never fired — and the
Dart-side notification was deliberately deleted in reliance on it. Blocked on Q-2.

### ERR-1 · There is no error-reporting sink anywhere
`EC-01` (= REL-26, LRE-27/28, **EC-23**) · **P0** · ✅ `VERIFIED_CLOSED` 2026-08-27 *(Workstream B Phase **B0**. Closure class **RELEASE / ENVIRONMENT** by owner ruling 2026-08-27, so §2.1 requires **FIXED IN CODE · VERIFIED IN CI** and nothing more. **FIXED IN CODE:** `580932f` — `lib/core/observability/app_failure.dart` (`AppFailure`, `FailureSink`, `reportFailure`/`reportError`, vendor-free per PD-A24, which stays open and does not gate the interface). **VERIFIED IN CI, post-fix half:** run **#33** `33043897947` — `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` green, so the sink compiles in context and B0's gate holds: a deliberately-failed read reaches the installed sink, the error object keeps its identity, and a throwing sink cannot break its caller. **VERIFIED IN CI, pre-fix half:** run **#34** `33081949579` step 7 — the EC-23 guard demonstrably FAILS against a tree carrying the seven historical `print()` call sites and PASSES against the restored tree, in CI. **EC-23 closes with it as an alias (§3).**)* · Wave 3 · *(the "do this before any other error-contract work" sequencing note is retained below as the historical record of why B0 ran first)*

No Sentry, no Crashlytics, no logging package, no `debugPrint`, no `developer.log` in
`apps/mobile`. Seven `print()` calls, inert in release. **All 234 failure sites are
invisible twice over:** the user cannot tell a failure from an empty state, and neither
can the operator, ever, in any environment, after the fact. Every finding in the error
domain is currently unmeasurable in production, so no fix can be verified as effective
and no regression in one can be detected. **Additive, cannot change behaviour, blocks
nothing, unblocks everything.**

---

### ERR-2 · AI decision inputs degrade silently to empty
`EC-02` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 3 (source) / Wave 5 (verify)

`recent()` in `ai-coaching-engine` is literally `try { … return data ?? []; } catch {
return []; }` and ignores the destructured PostgREST `error` besides; `ai-generate-workout`
destructures six parallel reads as `{ data }` with `error` **never inspected**. A failed
read of `ai_memories` yields `injuries: []`. **Amplifier:** the confidence score is
computed from the lengths of those same silently-emptied arrays, so a failed read is
scored identically to a brand-new user — *the number that exists to tell a client how much
to trust the advice cannot tell the difference.* Governance: a trace recorded over
silently-degraded inputs is not an audit record, which voids the decision-log invariant.
**Contract: rule S.** Source fix is independent of deployment and lands now.

---

### ERR-3 · Onboarding marks itself complete after the save fails
`EC-03` (= CON-02) · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 4

`intake_flow_screen.dart:215-228` — on a throw the handler explicitly writes
`{'onboarding_complete': true, 'onboarding_step': 0}` and routes to `/home`. PAR-Q
answers, medical conditions, injuries, allergies, dietary restrictions, goal, experience
**and consent** are discarded while the user is recorded as fully onboarded and can never
return. `_saveProgress` Phase 2 is `catch (_) {}`, dropping the whole step's data on any
one field's type rejection. **This is the parent of CON-04, E-NUT-05, ERR-2 and DAT-2 —
it is the reason `risk_*` is frequently null.** Depends on CON-03 (the serializer
mismatch is what triggers it today) and now also on SEC-R2 (the PAR-Q trigger throw is a
second trigger for the same fail-open).

---

### ERR-4 · Absent risk data renders to the coach as "low risk"
`EC-04` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 3

`client_detail_screen.dart` — `d['risk_level'] as String? ?? 'low'` at four call sites,
over a provider that already returns `null` for the entire profile on any read failure.
**"The read failed" and "the client is low risk" are the same pixel.** Combined with
ERR-3, *a coach is affirmatively told a client is low risk when the client's PAR-Q was
never saved.* The default points in exactly the wrong direction on a safety signal.
Display fix is independent and safe: render "not assessed", visually distinct from an
assessed `low`. **The policy half is CON-04 and stays blocked.**

---

### AI-1 · `materialize_program_week` has no caller anywhere in the app
`ENG-01` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 5

The Dynamic Program Builder plans, versions and saves an engine program; **nothing ever
materializes a week.** Its own success message tells the coach to "materialize week 1
from Coach Copilot / the client program view" — no such affordance exists in either
screen. An engine-generated program reaches the client with **zero `program_workouts`
rows**. CRC-10 at its most consequential.

---

### AI-2 · `weekly_feedback.subject_id` is never written
`ENG-02` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 5

One unwritten column silently disables four systems: `predict_client` always returns
`no_data`; `assemble_weekly_review` always returns `no_feedback`, so no weekly review can
ever be created from in-app feedback; `evaluate_week` reads `coaching_mode` through
`fb.subject_id` → NULL → **`needs_approval` never fires for coach-guided clients**,
silently disabling the approval matrix; and `regenerate_program` stamps
`decision_traces.subject_id` NULL, so a subject can never read the trace of their own
program change. **Fix the writer before generating any fixture data, or the fixtures
encode the defect** (CRC-14).

---

### AI-3 · Equipment vocabulary mismatch — the engine selects nothing even after the substrate is populated
`ENG-25` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 5

`score_exercise` tests `(p_context->'equipment') ? ex.equipment` — exact string
membership. The seeded library stores `equipment` as the first element of
`equipment_required`: `dumbbells`, `cable_machine`, `barbell`. Coach Copilot supplies
`['barbell','dumbbell','cable','machine','bodyweight']`. **Only `barbell` matches.**
Everything else scores `equipment_match = 0` and is rejected under
`EQUIPMENT_CONSTRAINT`. Sibling: **ENG-26**, five of ten warm-up pattern slugs never
match (`hinge` ≠ `hip-hinge`). **These two are why populating the substrate alone will
not make the engine work.**

---

### AI-4 · The intelligence substrate is unpopulated in QA
`ENG-17` (= F-J-06, ENV-03) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 5

`exercise_intelligence` holds 0 profiles against 621 exercises; the movement graph holds
0 nodes and 0 edges. `build_workout` answers **HTTP 200 with `selected: []`** — no error,
no status, no triggered rule (that is AI-5). Nine decision traces exist on QA and every
one is an empty decision. **This is not evidence of a broken engine.** Separately, the
only automated builder — `rebuild_exercise_intelligence()` — writes neither
`contraindications` nor `joint_stress`, the two columns the injury rule reads, so even a
fully populated substrate would leave `injury_compatibility = 100` for every exercise and
`INJURY_PREVENTION` unable to fire (**F-J-23**). **Blocked on D-1** (which review status
is engine-eligible) — under an `approved`-only rule, populating the substrate yields an
engine that still selects nothing until a human reviews 22+ exercises.

---

### AI-5 · An unplannable request returns HTTP 200 with an empty plan
`F-J-08` (= ENG-08 adjacent) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 5

`build_workout` cannot distinguish "no exercise fits" from "the substrate is empty" from
"the equipment vocabulary does not match", and reports all three as success. Migration
119 already chose *refuse* for `materialize_program_week`; whether `build_workout` agrees
is **D-2**.

---

### AI-6 · The PAR-Q classification and structured allergies are read by nothing
`F-J-05` (= CON-04 consumption half) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 5

`risk_level`, `risk_flags` (including `pregnancy`, `postpartum`,
`doctor_advised_no_exercise`) and `food_allergies` are captured, server-classified and
stored — and **no AI prompt reads them.** `score_exercise` has no PAR-Q dimension at all:
passing `risk_level: 'high'` changes no score by a single point. The nutrition coach that
produces meal plans and grocery lists receives **no subject context whatsoever**
(F-J-26). Mechanism is cheap and clear; **policy is D-4 and is clinical.**

---

### EDGE-1 · `notify-coach-email` has no authentication and injects unescaped attacker HTML
`E-01` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` (as deletion) / `BLOCKED_DECISION` (as fix) · Wave 5

No auth of any kind; the platform default `verify_jwt = true` is satisfied by the
**published anon key**. Any internet caller can enumerate the coach roster size, cause an
email to **every coach**, and control the body — `client_name` and `client_email` are
interpolated **raw** into a 12 Circle–branded HTML template. A branded phishing link
delivered from the platform's own sender to every coach, repeatable at will. **The
function has no caller in the codebase.** Recommended: delete it (D-4 in Workstream D).
Not deployed to QA; **UNVERIFIABLE** whether it is deployed to production.

---

### EDGE-2 · `send-checkin-reminder` has no authentication and no idempotency
`E-02` · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 5

The handler never reads the `Authorization` header, though its own file header states it
is invoked only by `pg_cron` with a service-role bearer. Any anon-key holder triggers, for
every active relationship whose client has not checked in this week, one `notifications`
row and one email. **No idempotency guard at all** — N invocations produce N notifications
and N emails per client. This re-opens at the function layer, with service-role privilege,
the notification-insert hole that 116 and 118 closed at the RPC and table layers.
**Decision D-5:** service-role gate, or move the sweep into SQL and remove the HTTP
surface entirely (recommended — it deletes the attack surface).

---

### BIL-1 · The webhook has no idempotency store; session credits are re-granted on every redelivery
`K-01` (= E-08, I-PAY-01, REL-24) · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 6

`checkout.session.completed` for `kind='package'` performs `.insert()` — not `.upsert()`
— with no conflict target and no `stripe_event_id` ledger, and the handler 500s wholesale
if any later statement throws **after this insert has already committed**. Stripe retries
any non-2xx for ~3 days. **Every sibling write in the same handler uses
`upsert(..., {onConflict})`; this one line is the exception.** A single retried event
grants a second block of paid coaching sessions.

---

### BIL-2 · Paid AI features have no server-side entitlement check
`K-03` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 6

`PaywallGate` is client-side presentation. The AI Edge Functions and
`generate_client_plan()` perform no plan check, so a free account can consume paid AI
directly. Combined with **P-11** (no Anthropic spend cap in QA and no rate limit across
12 AI functions) this is an uncapped cost surface as well as an entitlement one.
**Programme invariant §16: the client UI is never the authority for entitlement.**

---

### BIL-3 · A paid event ticket can be self-granted
`K-04` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 6

`event_registrations`' policy has no `WITH CHECK`, so a member sets `paid`/`payment_id`
themselves. **Fix in one change with DAT-4** — same table. Corrected repro: omit
`ticket_code`.

---

### BIL-4 · Session credits are granted but never consumed or enforced
`K-05` · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 6

Nothing decrements a credit and nothing checks the balance before a session is booked.
With **K-25** (the credit table's UPDATE policy lets a coach rewrite the balance *and its
owner*) the paid-coaching ledger has neither an authoritative writer nor an authoritative
reader. Fix as one unit: a `book_coaching_session()` RPC consuming credits under a row
lock, plus the policy narrowing.

### UIX-1 · The booking screen is dead for every client
`M-03` · **P0** · `REMEDIATED` *(2026-08-28, Wave 3A task 3A-8 — see §7.16)* · Wave 3

`/appointments` and `/book-call` issue a PostgREST embed (`coach:coach_id(...)`) with no
backing FK, so the query fails for every client. *Recommendation: drop the embed and read
coach profiles from `public_profiles`* — no migration, and it matches the pattern
`coach_relationship_service.dart` already uses.

**Closure class fixed by owner ruling 2026-08-28: PRODUCT INTEGRITY / UI REACHABILITY.**
`QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md` §2.1, that class's row verbatim — *"FIXED IN CODE · VERIFIED IN
CI · VERIFIED END-TO-END (a human or a driver reached the surface)"*. **Three states. The
ruling explicitly does not add `FIXED ON QA` or `VERIFIED LIVE` to this class**, and none
is claimed here. **PD-A23 answered 2026-08-28, option (b)** — engineering owner; recorded
in [`decision-log.md`](decision-log.md); option (a) was not implemented and no migration
was created.

**BEFORE (live, Workstream M §M-03, frozen evidence):**
`GET /rest/v1/coach_client_relationships?select=coach_id,status,pending_at,activated_at,coach:coach_id(...)`
→ `PGRST200` *"Searched for a foreign key relationship between 'coach_client_relationships'
and 'coach_id' in the schema 'public', but no matches were found."* The identical query
**without** the embed returned the client's real active relationship. Root cause read from
the migrations, not inferred: `000_baseline_preexisting_tables.sql:237` —
`coach_client_relationships_coach_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (coach_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id)`.
PostgREST cannot traverse a foreign key whose target is outside `public`.

**FIXED IN CODE:** `booking_screen.dart` only — the embed is dropped, the relationship
query is unchanged apart from the embed, coach display fields are read in a second query
against `public_profiles` (`.inFilter('id', coachIds)`, migration 110 projects every field
this screen renders), and the two are joined in Dart, the pattern
`coach_relationship_service.dart:60–77` already uses. **No migration, no schema, no RLS.**

**Two corrections inside that file, both required for the remediation to function, both
recorded rather than silent.** (i) `user_profiles.specialties` is `text[]` (`001:42`) and
this screen renders it as a comma-separated `String?` it splits itself (`:512`). The embed
never returned, so the `as String?` cast had never executed; it would throw the moment the
read worked. Normalised once at the join. (ii) The `catch` set `_BookingState.noSlots` — a
failed read presented as a confident statement about the coach's availability, which is
**invariant I-1** (*"No user-facing success state … unless authoritative evidence confirms
the underlying operation succeeded"*) and **I-5** (*"An empty value is an answer. It must
never be a symptom"*). A failed load now renders a distinct honest state. Everything else —
state semantics, the pending/active/no-coach branches, the multi-coach picker, booking and
cancellation — is unchanged.

**VERIFIED IN CI: PENDING.** The guard exists and its pre-fix/post-fix behaviour is
demonstrated (§7.16), but **it has not yet run in CI on this tree** — `QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md`
§4: *"A passing suite that has never run in CI"* is not a closure. It runs inside
`npm run test:contract`, already wired to the `static-guards` job, so no CI change is
needed; the rung opens on the next run.

**⚠ VERIFIED END-TO-END: ABSENT.** The class terminates there — *"a human or a driver
reached the surface"* — and Step 4 (End-to-End Product Verification) **is not authorized to
begin** (§7.10). No substitute was recorded and no waiver was sought. **Status: NOT
`VERIFIED_CLOSED`** — one of three required states present, one pending CI. **No status
count was moved** (§7.16).

### UIX-2 · No in-app account deletion, and the app states that there is
`REL-04` (= M-06, K-16, I-USR-01(b)) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 7

App Store Guideline 5.1.1(v) makes in-app deletion mandatory for any app supporting
account creation. Worse than absent: `help_center_screen.dart:45` instructs users to "Go
to Profile → Settings → Account → Delete Account" — **a path that does not exist** — and
the privacy-policy screen makes the same promise. Simultaneously a compliance blocker and
a false in-app statement. Compounded by **I-USR-01(a)**: 53 of 143 foreign keys restrict
deletes, so both program deletion and account deletion are blocked at the schema level
(Q-7). **Until it ships, correct the false help-centre and privacy-policy text** — that
half needs no decision and should land in Wave 1.

**2026-08-24 · Wave 1 batch task 8 — text half `REMEDIATED`, wording `REQUIRES_REVIEW`.**
The false in-app-path claims are removed and pinned by
`account_deletion_claims_test.dart`. The replacement text, however, promises an
**email-based deletion path** (support@/privacy@12circle.app, permanent removal within
30 days) — a user-facing support/policy commitment not traceable to a recorded owner
decision. The wording is held at the custody checkpoint for explicit owner approval or
substitution before commit. The feature half is unchanged: `BLOCKED_DECISION`, Wave 7.

### REL-1 · iOS build cannot be produced
`REL-01` + `REL-02` + `REL-03` · **P1** *(rated P0 by G; see §5 on gate-vs-impact)* · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 8

No CocoaPods integration (`flutter_local_notifications` and `record` ship no
`Package.swift`, so SPM alone cannot resolve the graph); `mobile_scanner 6.0.11` needs
iOS 15.5 against a declared target of 13.0, so `pod install` fails outright; no
`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, no entitlements, no profile, legacy `"iPhone Developer"` identity.

### REL-2 · Digital subscriptions sold through Stripe
`REL-05` (= D-K1) · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 6/8

`self_guided` ($29/mo) and `ai_guided` ($59/mo) are digital services delivered in-app;
Guideline 3.1.1 requires IAP and `checkout_launcher.dart` redirects to hosted Stripe
Checkout. The coach subscription has a plausible 3.1.3(e) argument; the two digital tiers
almost certainly do not. **The single largest architectural item between the product and
iOS distribution.** Option (a) adds a *second* entitlement source of truth on top of a
webhook that is not yet idempotent — which is why K sequences it after BIL-1/BIL-2.
**Decision D-1.**

### REL-3 · QA tooling ships in release builds
`REL-06` (= LRE-26) · **P0** · ✅ `VERIFIED_CLOSED` 2026-08-26 *(Wave 1 batch task 7 — compile-time `kQaToolingEnabled = !kReleaseMode` route gate + affordance gating (recorded scope extension); `release_route_gate_test.dart` executed in CI at `6d42b10` — see §7.8)* · Wave 1

`/qa-center` and `/mie-debugger` are wired unconditionally into the shipping router,
gated by neither `kReleaseMode` nor a role check. Only **4 uses of
`kReleaseMode`/`kDebugMode` exist in the entire client**, so the audit should be broad,
not limited to these two routes. *(The broad-audit instruction produced finding
**W1B-N2**, §7.7 — `/admin-exercise-review` and `/vendor-portal` carry no UI role
check.)*

### REL-4 · Password reset and OAuth have no return path on iOS
`REL-08` (= M-11) · **P0** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` · Wave 8

`redirectTo: kIsWeb ? … : null` at four call sites, no `CFBundleURLTypes`, no associated
domain. Sign in with Apple and Google Sign-In are both in `pubspec.yaml`, so this is the
primary sign-in path, not an edge case.

---

### REL-5 · No report / block / moderation surface for user-generated content
`REL-16` · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 7

The app ships community and 1:1 messaging; an exhaustive search finds no report, block or
mute affordance anywhere in `lib/`. Guideline 1.2 requires a content filter, a report
mechanism, a block mechanism, a published EULA and a documented 24-hour response
commitment — the last of which is an **operational** commitment needing a named owner.
**Decision D-3.**

---

### REL-6 · No hosted privacy, terms or support URLs
`REL-17` · **P0** · `BLOCKED_DECISION` · Wave 7

All three exist only as in-app Flutter screens. Edge Functions default their redirect
targets to `https://12circle.app/...`, implying a domain this programme **cannot confirm
is registered or controlled** (D-4: canonical name and domain). Settings exposes Privacy
Policy and Help Center but not Terms of Service, though the screen exists.

### TST-1 · The live security suite has never executed
`N-01` (suite half) · **P0** · ✅ `VERIFIED_CLOSED` 2026-08-26 *(EB-1 resolved; the six suites executed in CI at `6d42b10` — 271/271. The row below is the historical statement)* · Wave 1

188 live authorization assertions across six suites, written to fail against the
pre-remediation database and to pass after — **not run in any workstream session**,
because `QA_SERVICE` is not present in any working copy. Phase 1's evidence is therefore
a point-in-time claim that nothing currently re-verifies, and §4.2 proves the posture has
drifted since. **Blocked on: a scoped QA service key in CI secrets.** This is the single
highest-value environment unblock in the programme.

Evidence-only row: §7 carries no per-row status field, so this row is NOT status-countable** — the F-J-12 precedent (§7.12, `REMEDIATION_PROGRESS.md` §3). `workout_set_logs.created_at` does not exist; the column is `logged_at` (`001_full_ecosystem.sql:158–168`). Three references in `getExerciseProgression()` named the phantom column; every caller swallowed the 400, so a headline strength-progression screen was permanently and convincingly empty. **FIXED IN CODE:** `654b09c` — `workout_service.dart:237,243,246` `created_at`→`logged_at` (+3/−3; `catch (` count 14→14, EC-11 untouched; no migration). **FIXED ON QA:** the column has existed as `logged_at` since 001, and its presence in the **live catalog** is evidenced by real read-only requests against QA — `QA_WORKSTREAM_H_PRODUCT_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md` §120–123, 2026-08-24: `workout_set_logs?select=logged_at` → **401 `42501`** *(permission denied — PostgREST resolves the column before it checks the grant, so this is a positive existence oracle)* and `workout_set_logs?select=created_at` → **400 `42703`** *(column does not exist)*. Corroborated by run **#35** `33092528474` step 11 *Live SQL evidence*, whose ENV-3 live ledger proves migrations **000–128** are applied to QA. *(Evidence correction, 2026-08-27, owner-authorized: this sentence previously credited the *Contract suite* with reading "QA's live catalog". It cannot — `supabase/tests/contract/run.mjs:5` states "Offline. Contacts no environment", and the file contains no network call and reads no credential. That evidence belongs to **VERIFIED IN CI**, where it is retained below. No state, count, class or dependency changed.)* **VERIFIED IN CI:** run **#35** (head `654b09c`, all five jobs `success`) — `flutter analyze`, `flutter test` (H-G1 green) and `npm run test:contract` green with **both** allowlist halves removed: `known-violations.json`'s `I-WRK-01` entry and `product_contract_guard_test.dart`'s H-G1 `knownMissing` entry. Both are checked in both directions, so removing either alone fails. **VERIFIED LIVE: PRESENT** — CI run **#41** `33129000361`, job `wrk01-live` `98714155399`, head `8843c33`, 2026-08-28. Closure class is **Data contract / schema**, whose §2.1 ladder requires *"VERIFIED LIVE where a read path exists"*, and a read path exists (`getExerciseProgression()` → the strength-progression surface). Owner ruling **D-2** refused to waive it and **D-2(c)** required the **actual read path** to fail against the pre-fix tree and pass against the fixed tree **on the same QA fixture**; the comparison was not weakened and no substitute was recorded. The capability blocker §7.14 recorded is now closed by the `wrk01-live` job (`ci.yml:448`), which runs the real `WorkoutService().getExerciseProgression()` from `integration_test/wrk01_progression_live_test.dart` on a Linux desktop target under `xvfb`, twice against one live QA fixture — once at the run head and once at the **real parent** `654b09c^` = `acd2cc5`, whose `workout_service.dart:237,243,246` still name `created_at`. **PRE-FIX (`acd2cc5`), observed in the run log:** `WRK01-MARK FIXTURE present rows=4` · `WRK01-MARK SERVICE-CALLED getExerciseProgression` · `WRK01-MARK RESULT len=0` · `WRK01-MARK ASSERT-NONEMPTY FAIL` — the same fixture, the real service, an empty result, and the non-empty expectation is the assertion that failed. **POST-FIX (`8843c33`, carrying `654b09c`), same fixture, same probe:** `WRK01-MARK FIXTURE seeded rows=4` · `WRK01-MARK SERVICE-CALLED getExerciseProgression` · `WRK01-MARK RESULT len=3` · `WRK01-MARK ASSERT-NONEMPTY PASS` · `WRK01-MARK ASSERT-ALL PASS`. **QA hygiene (closure standard §7):** `WRK01-MARK CLEANUP verified remaining=0` — every fixture row is enumerated and removed and the removal is proved **by a read**, not assumed from a `204`. All six jobs `success`; `wrk01-live` steps 1–7 all `success`. See §7.15. **Status: `VERIFIED_CLOSED` 2026-08-28** — all four states the **Data contract / schema** class demands are present, with no waiver and no exception. **The row remains evidence-only and is NOT status-countable, and no status count was moved** — §7 carries no per-row status field (D-1, §7.14; the `F-J-12` precedent, §7.12 and `REMEDIATION_PROGRESS.md` §3). Which bucket the status table currently holds `I-WRK-01` in still **cannot be determined from this repository and was not guessed**. **§10 one-line test — if this defect were reintroduced tomorrow by a plausible, well-intentioned change, what exactly goes red, and where does someone see it:** three mechanized guards, all standing. **(i)** `npm run test:contract` in `static-guards` — `known-violations.json` carries **no** `workout_set_logs.created_at` entry and is checked in **both** directions, so re-naming the phantom column fails the job and there is no allowlist route back. **(ii)** H-G1 in `product_contract_guard_test.dart` — the `knownMissing` map no longer holds the entry, so *"no phantom column outside the recorded allowlist"* fails in the `flutter` job. **(iii)** `wrk01-live` step 6 — the post-fix leg asserts `RESULT len=3` against a live QA fixture through the real service, so a regression both static guards missed still turns the job red. None of the three is "someone would notice". ⚠ **D-4 unresolved:** Workstream I rates this **P1** (`QA_WORKSTREAM_I_DATA_CONTRACT_REPORT.md:740`), Workstream H rates the same defect **P2** (`QA_WORKSTREAM_H_PRODUCT_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md:319`). §5 requires a departure from a source rating to be recorded in the row; the two source reports disagree with each other, so no rating is mechanically compelled and none is chosen here. ⚠ **D-5 unresolved:** Workstream I states the site count as both *"(Dart, 2 sites)"* (`:1132`) and *"(1 site)"* (`:1239`); `MASTER_REMEDIATION_WAVES.md:241` and the implementation both say **three** (`:237,243,246`). Waves and implementation agree; the workstream report is wrong in both of its statements — but correcting frozen A–N evidence is outside §10.2, so it is recorded, not rewritten. | no | 3A *(task 3A-5)* |

### 7.7 Wave 1 batch amendment — 2026-08-24/25

Recorded at the Wave 1 batch custody checkpoint. Closure evidence:
[`WAVE_1_BATCH_CLOSURE.md`](WAVE_1_BATCH_CLOSURE.md). Nothing here rewrites a
historical report; the A–N reports and Wave 0 text above are unchanged.

**Status movements (batch tasks 2–9).** `REMEDIATED` = FIXED IN CODE only; the tree is
not yet committed/pushed, CI has never executed, and EB-1 still blocks the live suites,
so nothing here is `VERIFIED_CLOSED` *(status as written at the 2026-08-24 checkpoint —

**New findings.** Per §10.4: each carries an ID, a CRC from §1, and a wave.

Left standing deliberately: task 8's authority covered only the deletion half | — | **owner** (whether export ships, or the claim is corrected) | Y | 7B |
| **W1B-N4** | P3 | CRC-13 | `supabase-keepalive.yml`'s header claims the anon key "is already shipped inside the mobile app binary + `app_constants.dart`" — untrue since ENV-4. The workflow is the one production-targeting file in the tree and no batch task owns it; not edited | — | no | Y | 8 |
| **W1B-N5** | P2 | CRC-13 | `supabase config push` writes the **entire** `config.toml` to the linked project, and the file deliberately declares almost no `[auth]`/`[db]` settings — a push to deploy the new `[functions.*]` block would silently reset QA's live auth configuration to CLI defaults. Until `config.toml` is reconciled with QA's live configuration and the reconciliation is recorded, the `[functions.*]` block may be deployed **only** per function via `supabase functions deploy` (the mechanism the existing release architecture already uses). Guidance recorded in `config.toml`, `docs/qa-environments.md` and the Wave 5 prerequisites | — | no | N | **5.0 — entry precondition** |
| **W1B-N6** | P2 | CRC-14 | `check-production-refs.sh` scanned with `git grep`, which reads **tracked files only** — so `ci.yml` and `qa-db-reset.sh` passed the guard locally while untracked (custody checkpoint, 2026-08-25) and failed it in CI the moment the custody commit made them tracked (run for `9319c67`). The two flagged usages were refusal/assertion references, not executable production paths (classification B): both were rewritten in QA-allowlist form with no production literal (the ci.yml artifact scan is now strictly stronger — it fails on *any* non-QA project ref), and the guard now scans `--untracked`, demonstrated to catch what the old invocation missed. **Remediated in the same change** (2026-08-25); CI must reproduce | — | no | N | 1 *(closed with the CI-red fix)* |
| **W1B-N7** | P2 | CRC-14 | The ENV-4 inline CI check matched **documentation placeholders** as credential material: its patterns (`supabase\.co`, `pk_(test|live)_`) flagged `YOUR_QA_REF.supabase.co` and `pk_test_...` in `app_env.dart`'s usage comment, failing the `aac64b3` run's static-guards job at the step's **first-ever execution** (run 1 died at step 1, so steps 2–4 had never run — same class as W1B-N6: two tasks verified alone, integrated only in CI). Root cause: guard aimed at the wrong layer — shape-of-material was not part of the pattern. Remediated by matching **real material only** (20-char lowercase-alphanumeric project host · `eyJ`+20 token chars · `pk_(test|live)_`+24 alphanumerics) with comments still scanned — a real key pasted into a comment still fails — plus an **inline pattern self-test** asserting real-shaped fixtures match and the aac64b3 placeholder shapes do not, so a weakened pattern fails the guard itself. Residual sub-threshold coverage: the production-ref guard and the QA-artifact allowlist scan. Old check shown failing on the current file; new check passes it, catches planted real material in comments, and the self-test catches a crippled pattern arm. **Remediated in the same change** (2026-08-25); CI must reproduce | — | no | N | 1 *(closed with the ENV-4 guard fix)* |
| **W1B-N8** | P2 | CRC-14 | With EB-1's secrets finally provisioned, the live-qa job reached the security suites for the first time and all six died at import: `ids.json missing`. The file is the generated map of the four fixture-identity UUIDs, written by `setup-identities.mjs`, gitignored by design (`.gitignore:34`; W1-T1 custody manifest; README: "generated, not authored") — so an ephemeral CI checkout can never contain it. The wave plan named the setup script as part of W1-B2's QA requirements; the ci.yml implementation omitted the step — the same first-joint-execution class as W1B-N6/N7. Remediated by one creds-gated step after the exact-host QA confirmation: `node supabase/tests/security/setup-identities.mjs` (idempotent: creates-or-repairs the four `p1-*@qa.12circle.test` identities, `is_demo`, seeds three P1-FIXTURE victim rows only if absent; no deletions). **This is the programme's first sanctioned standing QA write — explicitly authorized by the product owner 2026-08-25.** Harness untouched; ids.json stays untracked. CI must reproduce | EB-1 (resolved) | owner authorization RECORDED | N | 1 *(closed with the CI step)* |
| **W1B-N9** | P3 | CRC-14 | **Test-fixture defect, not a security defect.** The first full live run scored 270/271; the one FAIL, D-02 "public signup cannot mint an admin", never reached the boundary: hosted Supabase Auth rejects example/test domains at the public `/auth/v1/signup` route (`email_address_invalid` — docs: "Example and test domains are currently not supported"), so the probe's `@qa.12circle.test` address 400s before `handle_new_user()` fires. The security contract itself is proven by the three admin-API metadata probes in the same suite (role=admin/content_manager/superuser all degrade to `client`; migration 115's clamp is source-controlled), and the suite correctly failed closed on the unexpected status rather than counting an unexercised probe as a pass. Remediated by one line (`d02-role-escalation.mjs:127`): probe address → `p1-signup-public@qa.12circlefitness.com` — the owner-confirmed controlled business domain (2026-08-25), so a confirmation email can never reach a third party; the fixed-address + pre-delete/post-delete cleanup pattern is unchanged. No assertion logic, harness, Auth configuration or other fixture touched. Closes when CI shows 271/271 | — | owner domain confirmation RECORDED | N | 1 *(closed with the fixture fix)* |

### 7.8 Phase 1 live-evidence reconciliation — 2026-08-26 · evidence: CI run at `6d42b10`

Owner-approved promotion record. Evidence for every row below: the green CI run at
commit `6d42b10` — live security **271/271** across the six suites (D-01 43/43 ·
D-02 40/40 · D-03 27/27 · 1D 54/54 · 1E 73/73 · 1F 34/34), live AI suite passed
(characterization level — see holds), contract suite passed (allowlist intact), overall
workflow green. The suites were written to fail against the pre-remediation database
(`supabase/tests/security/README.md`), so this run supplies **VERIFIED LIVE** and
**VERIFIED IN CI** in one artifact. Commit `d151ee6` (suite failure accounting) was
reviewed at reconciliation: reporting-only, no assertion weakened.

**Promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` — 23 rows:**

**Deliberately NOT promoted — the row's missing evidence, exactly:** SEC-04 *(open
regression F-J-01: d04 has a documented blind spot on `materialize_program_week`'s
wrapper; needs migration 124 + I-MIG-03 class guard + live 403 probe — Wave 2)* ·
Q-4/PAR-Q closure *(SEC-R2 open: legitimate flag writes throw; needs 124 casts + live
three-flag write probe)* · SEC-09 *(REST suites cannot assert catalog `search_path`
state; `function-search-path.sql` is not wired into CI; needs FG-1 + I-MIG-03)* ·
SEC-11 and the 12 Phase 2 closures *(their live evidence is the 32-assertion workout SQL
suite, which has never run in CI; needs FG-2 — behavioural Dart halves did run)* ·
SEC-08 *(mechanical half live-verified in 1F §3; row stays open on decision Q-2)* ·
ENV-6 *(push-triggered runs proven; the row's own retest names a PR run — closes at the
first PR)* · LRE-34 / REL-36 / LRE-35 *(no CI guard exercises them; container-only

*(held uncommitted for owner wording)* · R-06 *(BLOCKED, EB-12)* · W1B-N1…N5 *(open by
design: N5 is the Wave 5.0 gate; N1→6.0, N2→2/7, N3→7B, N4→8)* · every AI-domain row
*(the AI suite pass is characterization-level; zero functions deployed — EB-2;
BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT stands)* · every contract/3A row *(the contract suite passed **with**
the allowlist — it proves the recorded-defect state, not closure)*.

**Follow-up evidence gaps — recorded, NOT implemented (owner assignment required, no
silent scope expansion):**

| ID | Gap | Covers | Suggested home |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FG-1** | Wire `supabase/tests/security/function-search-path.sql` into the live-qa CI job with a DB-credential path | SEC-09 promotion · I-MIG-03's live half | Wave 2 (2B) |
| **FG-2** | Wire the 32-assertion workout SQL suite (`supabase/tests/workout/*.sql`) into the live-qa CI job | SEC-11 + the Phase 2 re-verification cohort | Wave 2 retest scope |

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** Production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not
contacted. No REST, RPC, Auth, Storage, Realtime or Edge Function request was issued to
it. No migration was applied, reverted or pushed to it. No Edge Function was deployed to
it. The linked project remained `eyqtldjqpgpljlqvpowh` throughout. This reconciliation
changed governance documents only.

### 7.9 Live SQL evidence reconciliation — 2026-08-25 · evidence: CI run at `2a8d0b6`

The first execution of the SQL-level evidence phase (FG-1, FG-2, ENV-3 live),
against QA `eyqtldjqpgpljlqvpowh`. Every suite is one DO block that ends by
RAISEing its report, so all four rolled back: **no migration was applied, no
`db push` was run, nothing was written to `schema_migrations`, and production
`nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not contacted.**

| Suite | Result | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| **FG-1** · `function-search-path.sql` (SEC-09 live half) | **5 PASS / 0 FAIL** | SP-1 unpinned SECURITY DEFINER functions **0** · SP-2 unpinned functions of any kind **0** · SP-3 functions pinned outside `public` **0** · SP-4 `generate_client_plan` + `materialize_program_week` re-pinned **2/2** · SP-5 EXECUTE grants to PUBLIC or anon **0** |
| **FG-2a** · `phase2-contract.sql` (SEC-11 / Phase 2) | **20 PASS / 0 FAIL** | the AFTER-1…AFTER-8 matrix |
| **FG-2b** · `plan-day-titles.sql` (OBS-4 / migration 121) | **15 PASS / 0 FAIL** | — |
| **ENV-3** · live ledger comparison | **5 PASS / 0 FAIL** | L-1 0 · L-2 0 · L-3 0 · L-4 0 · L-5 123 rows vs 123 expected · INFO 123 authored and pending |

**Verified QA migration state: 000–122 applied; migration 123 authored, committed
and declared pending — not applied, not an applied ledger row.**

#### The FG-2 assertion count — 32 reconciled to 35

The two numbers describe the same two files, and the discrepancy is a counting
method, not a grouping:

- **32** originates in `QA_WORKSTREAM_N_TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` §"Live workout
  SQL", a **static inventory taken without running the suite** — its own row
  reads "not run — no credentials". It propagated from there into the custody
  manifest and the progress board's baseline table.
- **20 + 15 = 35** is what the unchanged files actually emitted when executed.
- The files have **one commit in their entire history** (`8e47f07`, W1-T1
  custody) and are byte-identical to what N inventoried, so suite growth is
  excluded. Neither contains a loop or a conditional block, so emission is
  deterministic — the same files always emit the same 35 lines.
- Static counting of these files is demonstrably unreliable: three independent
  static attempts produced 32 (N), and — at the FG-2 wiring checkpoint — 25 by
  counting `case when … then 'PASS'` ternaries, because the suites build report
  lines in more than one syntactic shape.
- **20 corroborates independently.** `PHASE_2_WORKOUT_TEST_MATRIX.md` records
  "20/20 AFTER assertions PASS" and `PHASE_2_WORKOUT_RECONCILIATION.md` repeats
  it. FG-2a's 20 is that same AFTER set, re-verified live in CI.

**Resolution: the executed count is authoritative — FG-2 is 35 assertions
(FG-2a 20 + FG-2b 15).** Workstream N's report is frozen evidence and is not
rewritten; its 32 is superseded, and the forward-looking references in this
registry and on the progress board are corrected. 32 was never a different
grouping.

#### Promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` — 2 rows

| Row | Class ladder | Evidence at `2a8d0b6` |
|---|---|---|
| **SEC-11** · a client could rewrite a completed session | as above | FG-2a. The matrix maps this finding to **AFTER-4a/4b/4c**, "completed history is immutable", and `phase2-contract.sql` asserts directly that a completed set cannot be un-completed. Not inferred from the suite passing as a whole |
| **OBS-4** · duplicate generated day titles | as above | FG-2b in full — 15/15. `plan-day-titles.sql` exists solely to pin migration 121's `plan_day_titles()` authority |

#### Owner ruling, 2026-08-25 — SEC-09's closure criterion. Additive amendment.

**The ambiguity, as it was documented.** §7.8 held SEC-09 for "needs FG-1 +
I-MIG-03". The reconciliation as first drafted read that bare finding ID as the
**class guard existing and running** rather than as I-MIG-03's own closure, and
promoted SEC-09 on FG-1's 5/5. The final governance audit of this checkpoint
found that reading contestable and could not resolve it from the repository:
§4.2 tracks the standing test itself as `I-MIG-03` and §7.8's follow-up table
pairs "SEC-09 promotion · I-MIG-03's live half" *(reading A)*, while §7.8's
SEC-04 clause two lines above says "I-MIG-03 **class guard**" explicitly where
the SEC-09 clause says bare "I-MIG-03" *(reading B)*. The ambiguity was
preserved and escalated rather than decided.

**The ruling.** The product owner ruled on 2026-08-25 for **reading B**: §7.8
distinguishes "I-MIG-03 class guard" from a bare "I-MIG-03", and the repository
does not provide sufficient authority to reinterpret the bare finding ID as
merely the class guard. **SEC-09 `VERIFIED_CLOSED` therefore requires FG-1 live
evidence AND I-MIG-03 itself at `VERIFIED_CLOSED`.**

**Effect on this checkpoint.** The SEC-09 promotion is **withdrawn**. SEC-09
remains **`ALREADY_FIXED`**, not `VERIFIED_CLOSED`. I-MIG-03 remains **open, in
records mode**, and is not promoted. **FG-1's 5 PASS / 0 FAIL stands as recorded
live evidence** — SP-1 and SP-2 assert the class schema-wide with 0 unpinned
functions of any kind, and SP-4 answers the one item the static durability guard
flagged as "claimed by 122's dynamic sweep — NOT statically verifiable, live
evidence is FG-1", 2/2. That evidence is not rescinded and is not re-run; under
this ruling it is **necessary but not sufficient** for SEC-09's closure. SEC-09
closes when I-MIG-03 closes — currently Wave 2 task 2A, where the durability
guard moves from recording the posture to enforcing it.

**Quotation correction.** An earlier draft of this section quoted §4.2 as "the
only reason to expect the next Phase-1-equivalent to hold". §4.2 reads, verbatim:
"the only reason to believe the next Phase-1-equivalent will hold". The
paraphrase never appeared in a committed revision; it is corrected here.

#### Deliberately NOT promoted

- **The remaining Phase 2 cohort** (WRK-01…WRK-06 and the session-determinism
  group). FG-2a's 20 assertions are the AFTER matrix and they passed, but
  promoting these rows requires mapping **each** registry row to its specific
  AFTER ids in `PHASE_2_WORKOUT_TEST_MATRIX.md` — a row-by-row reconciliation,
  not a bulk inference from one green suite. That is the next checkpoint.
- **WRK-07** and **WKA-04** are excluded outright: §4.1 already flags them with
  open regressions (`EC-11`, `EC-05`), and both are Dart error-contract halves
  no SQL assertion reaches. They stay until Wave 3B.
- **OBS-4-R1/R2/R3** — live-supported by FG-1's SP-1/SP-2/SP-4, but they sit
  inside a combined §4.1 row; splitting it belongs to the same row-by-row pass.
- **SEC-04 / SEC-R1 / SEC-R2 / SEC-R3 / F-J-01** — unchanged, OPEN. Nothing in
  this run touches them; migration 124 does not exist.
- **SEC-09** — **withdrawn from the promotion set by the owner ruling above.** FG-1's
  live half is done and recorded; the row waits on I-MIG-03's own closure.
- **I-MIG-03** — unchanged: CI-verified in records mode, enforcement deferred to 2A.
  Under the ruling above it is now also SEC-09's remaining gate.

### 7.10 Wave 2 P0 safety/authorization closure reconciliation — 2026-08-27 · evidence: CI run **#27** at `388b5c1`

Scope: the three Wave 2 P0 rows only — **SEC-R1 / F-J-01**, **SEC-R2 / F-J-17**,
**SEC-R3 / F-J-07**. No other row's status was examined or changed. This
reconciliation changed governance documents only.

#### The human-authority rulings, recorded as provided

The product owner ruled on 2026-08-27, in response to the `BLOCKED — AUTHORITY
REQUIRED` report raised at the preceding checkpoint. Recorded verbatim; not
reinterpreted.

1. **F-J-17 / SEC-R2 ruling: YES.** FJ17-7 satisfies the required §5.1 negative
   test.
2. **F-J-07 / SEC-R3 ruling: YES.** The 59/60/61 recovery threshold pair
   satisfies the required §5.1 negative/positive safety test.
3. **F-J-01 / SEC-R1 ruling: NO.** §5.1 does **not** apply to F-J-01. F-J-01 is
   governed as an authorization/security finding under SEC-R1.

**Where this ruling is recorded, and the gap.** It is recorded here, following
the in-repository precedent set by *"Owner ruling, 2026-08-25 — SEC-09's closure
criterion"* (§7.9) — the only established location for an owner ruling on
closure criteria. The repository has **no dedicated register for §5.1 / evidence
-sufficiency authority decisions**: `decision-log.md` is scoped to product and
architecture decisions ("why is it built this way?"), and
`MASTER_PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` §2's discipline attaches to rows that exist in
that document — these rulings have none. **No new location was invented.** The
gap is reported for owner assignment.

#### The evidence — CI run #27

`33032108346` · head `388b5c16` · event `push` · conclusion **`success`** ·
2026-08-27T02:04:05Z. Every job and every step green: *Static guards* (incl.
I-MIG-03 durability guard, records mode; ENV-3 static contract), *API*,
*Flutter* (analyze + test + QA bundle scans), *Negative control* (harness
self-test; M-1/M-2/M-3 mutate → declared FAIL set → restore → 20/20; WKT-204),
and *Live QA suites* — **Live security suite**, **Live AI suite**, **Contract
suite**, **Live SQL evidence** (FG-1, FG-2a, FG-2b, **F-J-17**, **F-J-07**,
ENV-3 ledger). `live-evidence.sh` fails the step on any `FAIL` line and on a
missing report banner, so a green step means 0 FAIL with the report actually
produced — a connection error cannot read as a pass.

| Row | FIXED IN CODE | FIXED ON QA | VERIFIED LIVE | VERIFIED IN CI | VERIFIED END-TO-END | §2.1 class → required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-R1** | ✅ 124 | ✅ ledger 127 | ✅ d04 §8 + j04-04C | ✅ same run | n/a | Security / authorization → **4 of 4 present** |
| **SEC-R2** | ✅ 126 | ✅ ledger 127 | ✅ FJ17 8/8 | ✅ Dart class invariant | ❌ **absent** | AI / safety input → **4 of 5 present** |
| **SEC-R3** | ✅ 127 | ✅ ledger 127 | ✅ FJ07 10/10 | ✅ j03 inversion + Dart | ❌ **absent** | AI / safety input → **4 of 5 present** |

#### Promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` — 1 row

| Row | From | Closing evidence at `388b5c1` |
|---|---|---|
| **SEC-R1** · `materialize_program_week` lost its authorization guard | `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` | Migration **124** restored the `can_act_on_program` wrapper over `materialize_program_week_engine`, re-`REVOKE`d from `PUBLIC, anon` and re-pinned `search_path`. The row's own *Tests* field is satisfied in both halves: `d04` §8 asserts the **class** — the five 116 wrappers read from the migration source at run time, not hand-copied — and with `KNOWN_OPEN = []` the exemption map is empty, so `materialize_program_week` is **probed and refuses**, the precise blind spot that let F-J-01 exist; the I-MIG-03 standing source guard runs in *Static guards*. `j04`-04C independently 403s an unrelated caller against a **real** foreign-owned program (week 99, non-destructive). §5.2's redefinition clause is met by FG-1 SP-4 (2/2 re-pinned) and SP-5 (0 EXECUTE to PUBLIC/anon). Owner ruling 3 above places the row in the **Security / authorization** class, whose four required states are all present |

**Retained limitation, recorded not waived.** SEC-R1's *Live QA* field names
three probes; two run. The positive legs — owning coach → 200, `service_role`
→ 200 — are asserted nowhere, so a wrapper that refuses *everyone* would be
indistinguishable from a correct one by the current evidence. §2.1's four
security states do not require the positive leg and §5.1's negative+positive
requirement was ruled inapplicable to this row, so this is a probe-completeness
limitation rather than a missing state — registered as **FG-3** below, in the
same form §7.8 used for SEC-05's retained limitation.

#### Deliberately NOT promoted — the missing evidence, exactly

- **SEC-R2 / F-J-17** and **SEC-R3 / F-J-07** — **one state short: VERIFIED
  END-TO-END.** Both are safety findings under §5.1 (PAR-Q risk and flags;
  recovery state), which places them in §2.1's **AI / safety input** class:
  *"all five. A safety input is never closed on source review"*. §2.1 closes
  with *"`VERIFIED_CLOSED` requires every state its class demands. There are no
  partial closures and no exceptions granted at implementation time"*, and §3
  step 12 repeats it. The owner's rulings 1 and 2 resolve the **shape of the
  §5.1 test** — the question that was escalated — and are honoured in full; they
  do not speak to the fifth state, and this reconciliation will not read a
  waiver into them. VERIFIED END-TO-END is Step 4 (End-to-End Product
  Verification), which is not authorized to begin. The consequence is
  structural, not incidental: **no safety finding in this programme can reach
  `VERIFIED_CLOSED` before Step 4 runs.**
- **SEC-04** — untouched. §7.8 held it on the F-J-01 blind spot, which SEC-R1's
  closure now resolves, so it is a **consequential promotion candidate**; it is
  outside the three rows this ruling authorizes and is **not** promoted here.
  Assigned to the next checkpoint.
- **I-MIG-03** — unchanged, open, records mode. The guard ran green in CI #27 but
  its own closure criterion is enforcement, Wave 2 task 2A. Under the
  2026-08-25 owner ruling it also remains SEC-09's gate; **SEC-09 unchanged**.
- Every other row — not examined.

#### Status-vocabulary gap — owner ruling required

SEC-R2 and SEC-R3 hold **four of five** states, and §2's status table has no
term for that position: `REMEDIATED` means *"not yet retested"* and
`RETEST_REQUIRED` means *"live assertion outstanding"*, and **both statements
are now false** for these two rows, while `VERIFIED_CLOSED` requires the fifth
state. Moving them to either would put a false evidence claim on the board, and
§2 of `QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md` forbids using the five states loosely in any
report or status board. Inventing a sixth status would be a governance decision
this session has no authority to take. **The rows therefore stay at
`READY_TO_REMEDIATE`** — an understatement, whose entry evidence (a wave ID)
remains true — with their full evidence recorded in the row and here. The owner
is asked to choose: (i) add a status to §2 for *"every state but END-TO-END"*,
or (ii) leave the rows understated until Step 4 closes them.

Note that §5 of this registry's summary table and the progress board's severity
table were **not** adjusted: neither was adjusted by the 23-row promotion at
`6d42b10` or the 3-row promotion at `2a8d0b6`, and changing the counting rule
here would be an invention. The discrepancy is pre-existing and is reported, not
silently fixed.

#### Follow-up evidence gap — recorded, NOT implemented

| ID | Gap | Covers | Suggested home |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FG-3** | Assert the **positive** legs of the 116 wrapper class: the owning coach → 200 and `service_role` → 200 for each of the five wrappers, so over-refusal is distinguishable from correct refusal | SEC-R1's *Live QA* field, third and second legs · the same limitation on the other four wrappers | Wave 2 (2A/2B), with the d04 §8 class work |

#### Board effect

`VERIFIED_CLOSED` **26 → 27** · `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` **180 → 179** · canonical
total **319** unchanged (37 + 48 + 24 + 179 + 4 + 27 = 319).

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc`
was not contacted. No REST, RPC, Auth, Storage, Realtime or Edge Function request
was issued to it. No migration was applied, reverted or pushed to any
environment. No QA write was performed by this reconciliation. The evidence
cited is CI run #27, which had already executed. This checkpoint changed
governance documents only.

### 7.11 PD-A05 ruling and F-J-12 reconciliation — 2026-08-27 · governance only

Scope: **`F-J-12` only**, plus the PD-A05 row it depends on. No other row's status was
examined or changed. No code, migration, test or environment was touched.

#### The ruling, recorded as provided

The product owner ruled on 2026-08-27:

- **PD-A05: OPTION (A)** — `decision_traces` reads are scoped to **subject + the subject's
  active coach + `admin`**. `content_manager` is **not** included.
- **M-1: `created_by` is RETAINED.** The option text was silent on this arm; the silence
  is resolved in favour of retention, on the auditability rationale — a coach must not
  lose the audit record of a decision they themselves made when a relationship ends.
- **M-3: correct the false sibling-policy premise in the governance record.** Sibling
  policies remain **separate decisions**; they are **not** changed by this ruling.
- **M-4: `F-J-12` is a SECURITY / AUTHORIZATION closure-class finding**, subject to the
  authoritative closure standard.

Recorded in `MASTER_PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` (row `PD-A05` → `ANSWERED`, with the corrected
premise) and in `decision-log.md` (the answer, the *why*, and the accepted trade-off) —
the location `MASTER_PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` §2 step 1 prescribes. This is the programme's
**first** `ANSWERED` decision row; the document's "nothing here is decided" banner is
qualified by a dated additive amendment rather than rewritten.

#### The premise correction (M-3), measured from the migrations

| Table | Migration | Subject arm | Coach arm | Staff arm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `predictions` | 095 | `subject_id = auth.uid()` | program ownership | `admin` + `content_manager` |
| `program_versions` | 093 | — | program ownership | `admin` + `content_manager` |
| `communications` | 096 | subject, `status='sent'` only | `coach_id = auth.uid()` | `admin` + `content_manager` |
| `intelligence_attribute_reviews` | 091 | — | — | `admin` + `content_manager` + `coach` |
| `decision_traces` | 089 *(the defect)* | subject + creator | none | `admin` + `content_manager` + `coach` |

**No sibling table uses `admin` alone**, and no sibling coach arm uses
`is_active_coach_of`. The claim to the contrary appeared in the PD-A05 row, in the
`F-J-12` row of §7.1, and in `QA_WORKSTREAM_J_AI_DECISION_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md`. The two
governance records are corrected in place. **Workstream J's report is frozen evidence and
is not rewritten** — the same treatment §7.9 gave Workstream N's superseded count. Its
premise is superseded by this section.

#### Implementation vs authorized policy — they do not match

| Read arm | 089 *(defect)* | **Option (a) — AUTHORIZED** | Applied migration **125** |
|---|---|---|---|
| subject | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| `created_by` | ✔ | ✔ *(M-1)* | ✔ |
| active coach of subject | ✘ | ✔ | ✔ |
| `admin` | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **`content_manager`** | ✔ | **✘** | **✔ ← divergence** |
| any `coach` | ✔ **← the defect** | ✘ | ✘ *(removed)* |

**Migration 125 is option (b) plus the retained creator arm.** It is committed
(`992dafe`), applied to QA, and its live assertion is green — but it is **not the
authorized policy**. One arm too wide.

**125 is left unchanged, deliberately.** Reverting it would re-open F-J-12 — a live,
proven, health-adjacent disclosure hole on a project with self-serve coach signup — while
the correction is prepared; editing it in place would create a sixteenth instance of
`ENV-2`'s in-place-edit defect (`CRC-13`). 125 is a strict subset of 089 on every arm, so
the interim posture is never wider than what QA carried before it. The correction is a
**forward migration**, and it is **not authorized by this ruling** — see below.

#### Evidence by closure rung — SECURITY / AUTHORIZATION class (§2.1: four states)

Measured against the **authorized** policy, option (a):

| State | Present? | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| FIXED IN CODE | ❌ | No migration implements option (a). 125 implements (b) |
| FIXED ON QA | ❌ | QA carries (b) — ENV-3 ledger frontier 127, green |
| VERIFIED LIVE | 🟨 partial | The non-distinguishing arms are proven; the (a)-distinguishing arm is not asserted at all |
| VERIFIED IN CI | 🟨 partial | Same assertions, same gap |

Probe-by-probe, against the checklist in the authorization:

| Probe | Proven? | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Unrelated / non-authorized coach **cannot** read | ✅ | `j04`-04A invariant, with `relCount === 0` asserted as the control. CI run #27 |
| Unrelated client **cannot** read | ✅ | `j04`-04A invariant. CI run #27 |
| `anon` **cannot** read | ✅ | `d05` §1. CI run #27 |
| `admin` **can** read | ✅ | `j04`-04B — `p1-admin` carries `role='admin'` (`lib.mjs` `IDENT`), so this probes the admin arm and not a staff arm generally. CI run #27 |
| No client may write or delete a trace | ✅ | `d05` §3, incl. "not even an admin can hand-write a decision trace" |
| **Subject can read their own traces** | ❌ **not asserted anywhere** | — |
| **Active coach CAN read the subject's traces** *(positive leg)* | ❌ **not asserted anywhere** | — |
| **`content_manager` CANNOT read** *(option (a)'s distinguishing arm)* | ❌ **not asserted, and would FAIL today** | No `content_manager` fixture exists — `IDENT` holds exactly four identities: victim, attacker, coach, admin |
| **`created_by` can read** *(the M-1 arm)* | ❌ **not asserted anywhere** | — |
| **Policy durability** | ❌ **no rung exists** | The I-MIG-03 durability guard tracks *function* properties only — `auth-wrapper`, `search-path-pin`, `security-definer`. **RLS policies are outside its coverage entirely**, and Gate 0.14's wording does not name them. 125 itself `DROP POLICY … CREATE POLICY` under a **new name**; nothing would have caught a weaker replacement |

**The evidence that exists proves the defect is closed. It does not distinguish option (a)
from option (b) in either direction.** Every assertion currently green holds identically
under both.

#### Governance state

**`F-J-12` is NOT promoted and remains OPEN.** Two of four required states are absent and
two are partial. Under §2.1 — *"`VERIFIED_CLOSED` requires every state its class demands.
There are no partial closures and no exceptions granted at implementation time"* — and §3
step 12, the ruling alone closes nothing. **The standing rule that implementation does not
itself establish authorization is preserved and is now demonstrated in both directions:**
migration 125 existing did not authorize option (b), and PD-A05 being answered does not
close `F-J-12`.

**Board counts are unchanged.** `F-J-12` is a §7 P1 row and the register carries no
per-row status field; none is invented here. `MASTER_PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` §2 step 3
("move every finding it blocked from `BLOCKED_DECISION` to `READY_TO_REMEDIATE`") is
**reported as not executable** for that reason, rather than approximated.

**PD-A05's answer also releases the decision dependency recorded on `E-04`, `E-16` and
`ENG-22`** (all cite D-7). Their rows are **deliberately not edited** — they are outside
the row this ruling names, and a follow-up reconciliation is the correct place for them.
`ENG-22` in particular should be re-examined once option (a) is implemented: it reads
under caller RLS and writes the explanation cache with **service role**, so a narrower
read arm changes its exposure materially.

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not
contacted. No migration was applied, reverted or pushed to any environment. No QA write.
No test was run, added, weakened or rewritten. This checkpoint changed governance
documents only.

### 7.12 Run #32 evidence reconciliation — 2026-08-27 · evidence: CI run **#32** at `ae5be13`

The first fully green run since the Wave 2 P0 work began. Verified independently
against the GitHub API, not read off a dashboard: run **#32** `33040663330`,
head `ae5be138`, conclusion **`success`**, all five jobs green — and **step 11,
*Live SQL evidence*, executed for the first time since the QA frontier moved to
128.** Runs #30 and #31 never reached it: the steps are sequential and the AI
suite failed at step 9, so steps 10–11 were skipped. That is why this run
supplies evidence the two before it could not.

**This section changes the status of exactly one row.** A green run is not a
closure; `live-evidence.sh` says so in its own footer, and §4 of the closure
standard says it twice.

#### What run #32 executed

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| Live security (six suites, incl. `d05` §9) | pass |
| Live AI — J-01 7/7 · J-02 15/15 · J-03 8/8 · **J-04 16/16** · J-05 3/3 | **49/49** |
| Characterized defects still reproducing | **17/17** — none silently vanished |
| Contract suite | pass (with the allowlist — it proves the recorded-defect state, not closure) |
| FG-1 function search-path posture | 5/5 |
| FG-2a phase-2 workout contract · FG-2b plan day titles | 20/20 · 15/15 |
| F-J-17 PAR-Q contract · F-J-07 rule accumulator | 8/8 · 10/10 |
| **ENV-3 live ledger** | **5/5 — 129 declared = 129 observed · 0 missing · 0 undeclared · 0 stale · 0 holes in 000–128 · pending: none** |

No migration was applied by the run, nothing was written to `schema_migrations`,
every SQL suite rolled itself back, and production was not contacted.

#### Promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` — 1 row

| Row | From | Closing evidence at `ae5be13` |
|---|---|---|
| **`F-J-12`** · `decision_traces` readable by every coach | OPEN | All four **SECURITY / AUTHORIZATION** states now present — the class was fixed by owner ruling **M-4**, and §2.1 requires exactly these four. **FIXED IN CODE**: migration 128. **FIXED ON QA**: ENV-3's live ledger at this run reconciles 129 = 129 through 128 with no hole, which retires the one inference §7.11 left open — 128's `schema_migrations` row is now *observed*, not assumed. **VERIFIED LIVE**: `content_manager` reads **0** rows where the identical probe read **90** at run #30 pre-128; unrelated coach 0; unrelated client 0; the subject reads 95/95 of their own; the active-coach and `created_by` arms proved positively in `d05` §9. **VERIFIED IN CI**: the same run, against #30's recorded red on the same assertion. §5.2's redefinition clause is met by the post-application catalog read-back (one SELECT policy, zero write policies, four arms, no `content_manager`); §5.2's *"test the class, not the instance"* clause is satisfied by owner ruling **M-3**, which scoped sibling policies as separate decisions rather than leaving them unconsidered |

**Retained limitations, recorded not waived.** (i) **RLS policies have no
durability guard.** The I-MIG-03 guard tracks *function* properties —
`auth-wrapper`, `search-path-pin`, `security-definer` — and Gate 0.14's wording
does not name policies. Nothing in this repository would notice a later
migration replacing this policy with a weaker one, which is F-J-01's exact
mechanism. (ii) J-04A's `created_by=neq` filter is NULL-rejecting, so a readable
`created_by IS NULL` trace would be invisible to that negative control; none is
readable under option (a), and J-04B's *"every trace names a subject and a
creator"* invariant holds, so there is no live weakening today.

#### Gate movement

- **Gate 2.6** — *"`decision_traces` reads are scoped to subject + active coach
  (+ admin if PD-A05 so decides) · live, with a probe coach holding zero
  relationships"* — **MET.** Run #32 satisfies the mechanism exactly: the probe
  coach's zero-relationship state is itself asserted, and PD-A05 decided admin
  **in** and `content_manager` **out**.
- **Gate 1.7** — *"a member can write `has_injuries`, `injury_locations`, a
  pregnancy and a postpartum state without error · live QA assertion"* —
  **MET**, re-confirmed by F-J-17's 8/8 at this run.
- No other gate row moved. **Gate 2 remains blocked** on 2.1 (Gate 1), 2.3 (the
  §4.2 regressions), 2.5, and 2.7–2.13.

#### Deliberately NOT promoted — the missing evidence, exactly

- **`SEC-R2` / F-J-17** and **`SEC-R3` / F-J-07** — unchanged. Their live
  evidence re-ran green (8/8, 10/10), which refreshes but does not extend it.
  Both remain **one state short: VERIFIED END-TO-END**, required by §2.1's
  *AI / safety input* class. Step 4 is not authorized, and §7.10's
  status-vocabulary gap is still open.
- **`ENV-3`** and **`SEC-11`** — **already `VERIFIED_CLOSED`** (2026-08-25,
  §7.9). Run #32 re-confirms them; there is nothing to advance. ENV-3's live
  ledger passing here is used as *evidence for F-J-12's FIXED ON QA rung*, not
  as a fresh closure.
- **`SEC-09`** — unchanged, `ALREADY_FIXED`. FG-1's 5/5 re-ran green, and under
  the owner ruling of 2026-08-25 that evidence is **necessary but not
  sufficient**: SEC-09 closes when **I-MIG-03** reaches `VERIFIED_CLOSED`.
- **`I-MIG-03`** — unchanged, and **escalated as an authority question**, not
  decided here. Its §4.2 mandate is a standing guard that no function carrying
  an authorization wrapper, a `search_path` pin or a security trigger may be
  redefined without carrying them forward. That guard now exists, is
  **fail-closed**, has `KNOWN_OPEN = []`, self-tests green, and passed at run
  #32 — so its *behaviour* is enforcing. But its `ci.yml` step is still titled
  *"records mode"*, and **no document in this repository states I-MIG-03's
  closure criterion**. Because closing it also closes SEC-09 by the standing
  owner ruling, this reconciliation will not infer that criterion. See §M of
  the accompanying report.
- **`SEC-04`** — still a consequential promotion candidate from SEC-R1's
  closure; outside the rows any ruling has named. Unchanged.
- **`E-04`, `E-16`, `ENG-22`** — their `D-7` dependency is discharged by
  PD-A05's answer; their rows are not edited here and await their own
  reconciliation. `ENG-22` should be re-examined on its merits now that the read
  arm is narrow: it reads under caller RLS and writes the explanation cache with
  **service role**.
- Every other row — not examined.

#### Board effect

`VERIFIED_CLOSED` **27 → 28**. **The status-count table on the progress board is
NOT adjusted**, and that is deliberate: `F-J-12` is a §7 P1 row and the P1–P3
register carries **no per-row status field**, so which bucket the count
currently holds it in cannot be determined from this repository. Inventing a
bucket to make an arithmetic line balance is exactly the failure this programme
exists to prevent. The gap is reported, and it is the same gap that made
`MASTER_PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` §2 step 3 inexecutable in §7.11.

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** production
`nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not contacted. No migration was applied, reverted or
pushed to any environment. No QA write was performed by this reconciliation. The
evidence cited is CI run #32, which had already executed. This checkpoint
changed governance documents only.

### 7.13 ERR-1 / EC-01 closure — 2026-08-27 · evidence: CI runs **#33** `580932f` and **#34** `80f248e`

One row closes here. Nothing else was examined or changed.

#### The governing rule, cited before the promotion

- **Closure class.** Owner ruling 2026-08-27: EC-01 is **RELEASE / ENVIRONMENT** —
  an internal platform observability capability with no user-facing success
  state of its own. The ruling is explicitly confined to EC-01 and does **not**
  extend to EC-05 or any other error-contract / false-success finding.
- **`QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md` §2.1**, that class's row, verbatim:
  *"FIXED IN CODE · **VERIFIED IN CI** — an environment guard that is not
  mechanized is not a guard."* Two states, and no VERIFIED END-TO-END.
- **§3 step 12:** *"Mark `VERIFIED_CLOSED` only when §2.1's required states all
  exist."* §2.1 adds: *"There are no partial closures and no exceptions granted
  at implementation time."*
- **§2**, the definition this checkpoint had to satisfy: VERIFIED IN CI is
  *"An automated check **fails against the pre-fix tree and passes against the
  post-fix tree, in CI**."*

**On the tension with §2 of this registry**, whose status table gives
`VERIFIED_CLOSED`'s entry evidence as "VERIFIED LIVE **and** VERIFIED IN CI":
§3 step 12 routes closure through §2.1's *class* ladder, and the programme has
already applied that reading five times — **ENV-1, ENV-4, ENV-5, REL-3 and
TST-1** were all promoted in §7.8 on CI evidence with no VERIFIED LIVE rung,
because their class does not demand one. This closure follows that precedent
rather than creating a criterion.

#### Evidence, independently verified against the GitHub API

| | Run #33 | Run #34 |
|---|---|---|
| id | `33043897947` | `33081949579` |
| head | `580932fc1313…` | `80f248e5656d…` |
| conclusion | `success` | `success` |
| supplies | the **post-fix / behavioural** half | the **pre-fix / historical** half |

**Post-fix half (run #33).** `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` both green, so
the sink compiles in context and every assertion in `error_sink_test.dart`
passed — B0's gate, *"suites green; a deliberately-failed read appears in the
sink"*, together with the error object keeping its identity and a throwing sink
being unable to break its caller.

**Pre-fix half (run #34), which is what this checkpoint added.** The negative
control at `apps/mobile/tool/negative_control/ec23_negative_control.sh`, wired
as **step 7** of the negative-control job, and that step's conclusion is
**`success`**. Its exit status is reachable only through the whole chain:
baseline guard PASS → mutator inserts one `print()` beneath each of the seven
`reportError()` call sites and **refuses to continue unless exactly seven
anchors matched** → the harness independently recounts and requires exactly
**seven** offenders in `lib/` → the guard run exits **non-zero**, required by
`[[ "$RC" -ne 0 ]] || die` rather than tolerated → the output must contain the
named assertion `no print() call site remains in lib/`, so an unrelated compile
or test failure would `die` instead of passing → both files restored and
verified **byte-identical** by `git diff --quiet … || die` → guard PASS again.
Any link failing exits the step non-zero.

**This is not G-3 synthetic evidence and must not be filed as such.** G-3 covers
the case where *"no defective tree is recoverable from history"*. Here one is —
the seven `print()` call sites live at `fabf495` and every commit before
`580932f` — so this is a genuine pre-fix / post-fix demonstration of a guard.
G-3 was not invoked. `ci.yml`'s job header was amended in `80f248e` to say so,
precisely so this step is never later mis-filed alongside the WKT-204 and
M-1/M-2/M-3 steps, which *are* of that class.

**It also supersedes a weaker artefact.** §7.12's predecessor evidence for this
guard was a **local algorithmic replay** — the guard's logic run by hand against
`fabf495` (7 offenders) and the post-fix tree (0). That replay was honest but it
was not "in CI", and §2 requires "in CI". Run #34 replaces it. The replay is
recorded here as superseded, not deleted.

#### On the two red annotations in run #34 — they are not failed CI

The negative-control job carries two `failure`-level annotations, *"1 test
passed, 1 failed."* (EC-23, step 7) and *"3 tests passed, 4 failed."*
(WKT-204, step 6). **Every step of every job in run #34 is `success`**, and
there is **no `continue-on-error` anywhere in the workflow** (0 occurrences at
`80f248e`). These annotations are the runner's test-log parser reacting to
Flutter's stdout while the mutation is installed; the step conclusion, not the
annotation, is authoritative. The EC-23 figure is in fact a confirmed
*prediction*: the EC-23 group holds exactly two tests, the mutation was designed
to break exactly one of them and to leave `reportError` in place so the other
still passes — **one passed, one failed** is the declared outcome, observed.

**The real suite is independently clean.** The *Flutter — analyze, test, QA web
build* job is a separate job, its `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` steps are
`success`, and its annotation set contains **only** the Node-20 deprecation
warning — no test-failure annotation at all. Nothing is masked.

**Limitation, recorded.** Raw job logs return **HTTP 403** to an unauthenticated
read, so the assertion-level log text was not read directly. The evidence used
instead is stronger for this harness, not weaker: the step's exit status is
reachable only if every assertion above held, and the harness source was read at
the exact committed SHA that CI executed.

#### Promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` — 1 row

| Row | From | Closing evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **`ERR-1` / `EC-01`** (= REL-26, LRE-27/28, **EC-23**) · P0 | `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` | Both states its RELEASE / ENVIRONMENT class demands: **FIXED IN CODE** (`580932f`) and **VERIFIED IN CI** in the strict §2 sense — fails against the pre-fix tree (#34 step 7) and passes against the post-fix tree (#33, and #34's baseline and restored runs) |

**`EC-23` closes with it**: §3 records it as an alias of EC-01, so it carries no
separate row and no separate count.

#### What this closure does NOT do

- **It does not touch `EC-05`.** The owner ruling is confined to EC-01 by its own
  terms; EC-05 remains governed by its own class, which requires VERIFIED
  END-TO-END for a user-facing success state.
- Phase **B0**'s remaining scope is unchanged: the §5.1 categories beyond
  category 1 are not wired, because classifying the ~234 swallow sites is
  **Phase B4**.
- No other row's status was examined. `I-MIG-03`/`SEC-09`, RLS-policy
  durability, the status-vocabulary gap, `SEC-04`, `E-04`/`E-16`/`ENG-22` and
  the CI step-ordering question are all untouched and remain open.

#### Board effect — mechanically reconciled, and one divergence retained

`ERR-1` is a **§6 P0 row that carries a status field**, so unlike `F-J-12` its
movement is mechanically countable and the table is updated:
`READY_TO_REMEDIATE` **179 → 178**, `VERIFIED_CLOSED` **27 → 28**, total
**319** unchanged (37 + 48 + 24 + 178 + 4 + 28 = 319).

**The narrative count is 29, and the table says 28. That divergence is exactly
`F-J-12` and it is deliberate**, carried forward from §7.12: `F-J-12` is a §7
P1 row and that register has **no per-row status field**, so which bucket the
table currently holds it in cannot be determined from this repository. It is
left uncounted rather than guessed at.

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** production
`nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not contacted. No migration was applied, reverted or
pushed. No QA write. The evidence cited is CI runs #33 and #34, which had
already executed. This checkpoint changed governance documents only.

### 7.14 `I-WRK-01` tracking home, `EC-11` dependency reconciliation, and the VERIFIED LIVE capability blocker — 2026-08-27 · governance only

Owner rulings **D-1 · D-2 · D-2(b) · D-2(c) · D-3 · D-4 · D-5**, 2026-08-27. **Documentation
only — no code, migration, test, policy, CI or acceptance criterion changed; no QA write;
no QA read; production not contacted.** No status was promoted and **no count was moved**.

#### D-1 · `I-WRK-01` now has a tracking home

Before this checkpoint `I-WRK-01` appeared exactly **once** in this registry — §3 line 167,
the alias map, which has no status column. It had no §6 row, no §7 row and no
progress-board row, so there was no legitimate place to record its evidence.

A **§7.6 row** is now established. Constraints applied:

* **Canonical key is `I-WRK-01`.** `H-01`, `M-07` and `M R-2` remain retired aliases (§3).
  **No `H-01` row was created and none may be**, per §3 (*"The alias must not be used as a
  tracking key after this document"*) and §10.5.
* **§6 was not used and could not be.** §6 is the **P0** register; this finding is P1/P2.
* **The row is evidence-only and is NOT status-countable.** §7's tables carry no per-row
  status field. This is the established position, not a new one: `REMEDIATION_PROGRESS.md`
  §3 already records that `F-J-12` is `VERIFIED_CLOSED` and *"is NOT in this figure … a §7
  P1 row and that register has no per-row status field, so its current bucket cannot be
  determined from this repository. Left uncounted rather than guessed."* The same applies
  here, and with more force: `I-WRK-01` is not closed at all.
* **Arithmetic unchanged.** §5 counts *canonical findings*, not rows — `I-WRK-01` was
  already inside the `Data Contract` domain's 33. Adding a row changes no total, and the
  progress board's status counts (37 + 48 + 24 + 178 + 4 + 28 = 319) are untouched. Which
  bucket currently holds `I-WRK-01` **cannot be determined from this repository and was not
  guessed.**

**Structural note, recorded because the ruling has wider reach than one finding.** Six
canonical findings sit in §3 with no row anywhere else in this registry — `I-LEG-03`,
**`I-WRK-01`**, `ENG-16`, `CON-06`, `CON-10`, `M-05`. (A seventh, `I-COM-03`, is covered by
the range row `I-COM-02`…`I-COM-06`.) D-1 was ruled for `I-WRK-01`; **the other five are
untouched and remain without a tracking home.**

#### D-2 / D-2(b) / D-2(c) · VERIFIED LIVE is required, and cannot currently be obtained

Closure class is **Data contract / schema**. `QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md` §2.1 requires
FIXED IN CODE · FIXED ON QA · VERIFIED IN CI · **VERIFIED LIVE where a read path exists**.
A read path exists (`getExerciseProgression()` → the strength-progression surface).
**D-2 refuses to waive it.** The ERR-1 / EC-01 RELEASE-ENVIRONMENT ruling was **not**
applied here; precedent forbids it anyway — SEC-R2 and SEC-R3 (§7.10) record that an owner
ruling on an adjacent question *"does not waive the fifth state"*.

**D-2(c)** requires the stronger comparison: the **actual read path** must fail against the
pre-fix tree and succeed against the fixed tree, on the same QA fixture. It was not
weakened, and no substitute was recorded as evidence.

**The comparison cannot be performed with the infrastructure this repository has.** The
architecture supports it; the capability does not. Established mechanically:

| Requirement | State |
|---|---|
| A mechanism that executes the real Dart service against a live project | **EXISTS** — `apps/mobile/integration_test/service_logic_test.dart` drives real service classes after `Supabase.initialize`, and post-ENV-4 `AppEnv` has no production default. `WorkoutService`'s `Supabase.instance.client` binding resolves correctly under it |
| A QA fixture for `workout_set_logs` | **REACHABLE IN PRINCIPLE** — `001:370` `"users manage own set logs" FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (user_id = auth.uid())`, so a fixture identity can insert and read its own rows. `supabase/tests/workout/phase2-contract.sql` already creates and rolls back `workout_set_logs` probe rows |
| **A CI job holding both a Flutter/Dart toolchain and a QA credential** | **DOES NOT EXIST.** `flutter` and `negative-control` have Flutter and **no** QA secret; `live-qa` holds `QA_URL`, `QA_ANON`, `QA_SERVICE`, `QA_DB_URL` and has **no** Dart toolchain. The two capabilities are in disjoint jobs |
| CI executing `integration_test/` | **DOES NOT** — the `flutter test` step runs with no path, which covers `test/` only; `integration_test/` additionally needs a device target |
| A local toolchain | **ABSENT** — no `flutter`/`dart` on the device VM or in the cloud container; both SDK archives return HTTP 000 (egress refused), re-verified 2026-08-27 |
| A local QA credential | **ABSENT** — `QA_URL`/`QA_ANON`/`QA_SERVICE`/`QA_DB_URL` all unset. Acquiring one was **not** attempted: D-2(b) authorizes a QA *write*, not credential acquisition |

**Minimum missing capability, stated so it can be authorized or refused as one item:** a CI
job that has a Flutter toolchain **and** a QA credential **and** a device target, running
`integration_test/` twice — once at `654b09c` and once at `654b09c^` — against one
rollback-scoped `workout_set_logs` fixture. Note that granting it widens QA credential
scope beyond the single job `ci.yml` currently confines it to, which is a security-boundary
change and was **not** made here.

`VERIFIED LIVE` is therefore recorded as **ABSENT**, and `I-WRK-01` stays
**NOT `VERIFIED_CLOSED`** with three of four required states present. §2.1 line 59 —
*"There are no partial closures and no exceptions granted at implementation time."*

#### D-3 · `EC-11`'s dependency reconciled

**Before:** §7.2's `EC-11` row carried `Dep` = **`H-01 first`**.
**After:** `Dep` = **`I-WRK-01` + `I-COM-01` + `I-CHK-01`**.

Two defects were corrected in one edit:

1. **Under-scoped.** `QA_WORKSTREAM_H_PRODUCT_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md:810` — *"closing EC-11's
   swallows before **H-01, H-02 and EC-10** converts silent empty states into permanent
   visible errors across the workout, event and check-in surfaces at once."* D-3 rules this
   the authoritative sequencing constraint.
2. **Retired alias used as a tracking key.** `H-01` is retired (§3:167); §10.5 closes the
   alias map. The cell is now written in canonical keys. This translation is compelled by
   §3, not chosen: `H-01` → `I-WRK-01`; `H-02` → `I-COM-01` (§3:168).

**`EC-10` needs a note, because it does not resolve to one canonical finding.** §3 splits it
across **`I-CHK-01`** (*checkins half*, §3:151) and **`I-LEG-03`** (*coach_tips half*,
§3:154). Workstream H's sentence names *"check-in surfaces"*, which maps to the checkins
half, so `I-CHK-01` is recorded. **Whether `I-LEG-03` also gates `EC-11` is NOT decided
here** and remains open.

**Two wider statements were left standing and not reconciled**, because D-3 authorized one
resolution and choosing between the remainder is a further ruling:
`QA_WORKSTREAM_H…:796` / `:868` gate `EC-11` on the whole **Wave H-A** batch (H-01, H-02,
H-03, H-05, H-06 client half — a set that does **not** contain EC-10), and
`MASTER_REMEDIATION_WAVES.md:260` states Wave 3B's prerequisite as **"3A complete (the H
dependency)"**, the widest statement in the programme and the only wave-level one.

**`EC-11` is not authorized to start.** `npm run test:contract` on this tree returns nine
allowlist entries — `checkins` (`I-CHK-01`, 7 sites), `coach_tips` (`I-LEG-03`),
`event_registrations.ticket_code` (`I-COM-01`), `custom_exercises.approved_by`,
`user_profiles.goal`, `user_profiles.equipment` and three `nutrition_logs` columns. **EC-11
was not started; `WorkoutService` was not touched.**

#### D-4 · Severity discrepancy — PRESERVED, NOT RESOLVED

Workstream I rates `I-WRK-01` **P1** (`…_I_DATA_CONTRACT_REPORT.md:740`); Workstream H rates
the same defect **P2** (`…_H_PRODUCT_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md:319`). §5 requires a departure from
a source rating to be recorded in the row — but here the two **source reports disagree with
each other**, so no rating is mechanically compelled. The row carries `P1/P2 ⚠`. **Owner
authority required.**

#### D-5 · Site-count discrepancy — PRESERVED, NOT RESOLVED

Workstream I states the count as both *"(Dart, 2 sites)"* (`:1132`) and *"(1 site)"*
(`:1239`). `MASTER_REMEDIATION_WAVES.md:241` and the landed implementation both say
**three** (`workout_service.dart:237,243,246`). Waves and implementation agree and the
workstream report contradicts itself, so the *fact* is settled — but §10.2 makes the A–N
reports frozen evidence (*"Update the row, not a report"*), so the report was **not
rewritten**. Recorded here instead.

*(Reconciling note: the guard-visible site count and the source-line count are different
measurements. `run.mjs` and H-G1 both key on the `.from(` line, so one call site with a
`select` and an `order` counts once to the guards and twice in source. This explains the
shape of the disagreement; it does not tell us which number either report intended.)*

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not
contacted. No migration was applied, reverted or pushed. **No QA write and no QA read were
performed** — the D-2(b) fixture authorization was not exercised, because the probe it
serves cannot be executed. The evidence cited is CI run **#35** `33092528474`, which had
already executed. This checkpoint changed governance documents only.

---

### 7.15 `I-WRK-01` VERIFIED LIVE closure — 2026-08-28 · evidence: CI run **#41** `33129000361` at `8843c33`

One row closes here. Nothing else was examined or changed. **Documentation only — no
application, SQL, migration, RLS, CI, fixture, probe or infrastructure file was touched; no
QA write and no QA read were performed by this checkpoint; production was not contacted.**

#### What this checkpoint supplies, and what §7.14 was missing

§7.14 (D-2 / D-2(c)) required the **actual read path** to fail against the pre-fix tree and
pass against the fixed tree **on the same QA fixture**, refused to waive it, and recorded
`VERIFIED LIVE` as **ABSENT** for one reason only: *"no CI job holds both a Flutter/Dart
toolchain and a QA credential"*, so the comparison **could not be executed**. Nothing about
the criterion is changed here. **The missing capability was built and run**, and run #41
supplies the one thing every prior checkpoint lacked — **the literal PRE-FIX runtime
observation**.

The closure class is unchanged: **Data contract / schema**, whose §2.1 ladder is
FIXED IN CODE · FIXED ON QA · VERIFIED IN CI · **VERIFIED LIVE where a read path exists**.
`getExerciseProgression()` is a read path, so the fourth rung was owed. **No waiver was
introduced, no exception was granted, and no closure criterion was modified.** The
`ERR-1`/`EC-01` RELEASE-ENVIRONMENT ruling was again **not** carried across, and the
SEC-R2 / SEC-R3 precedent (§7.10) — *an owner ruling on an adjacent question "does not
waive the fifth state"* — was again respected.

#### The mechanism, read at the committed SHA that CI executed

| Component | At `8843c33` |
|---|---|
| Job | `wrk01-live` · `ci.yml:448` · *"I-WRK-01 — live progression read path (pre-fix / post-fix)"* · `needs: [live-qa]` · `if: needs.live-qa.outputs.creds == 'true'` |
| Probe | `apps/mobile/integration_test/wrk01_progression_live_test.dart` — calls the **real** `WorkoutService().getExerciseProgression()`, not a replica |
| Driver | `apps/mobile/tool/negative_control/wrk01_live_probe.sh` under `xvfb-run`, Linux desktop target |
| Pre-fix tree | `PRE_FIX_REF=654b09c^` = **`acd2cc5`**, whose `workout_service.dart:237,243,246` still name `created_at`. A real defective tree exists in history, so **`G-3` was not invoked and this is not synthetic evidence** |
| Fixture | One `workout_set_logs` fixture keyed `WRK01-PROBE-$PROBE_RUN_ID`, written by the committed QA-only `is_demo` identity `p1-victim@qa.12circle.test` under `001:370` (*"users manage own set logs"*) |
| Credential posture | `wrk01-live` references **zero** `secrets.*`. All **18** `secrets.QA_*` references in the workflow remain confined to `live-qa` (`ci.yml:321`–`:437`, inside `live-qa`'s `304`–`447` span). **No `QA_SERVICE` and no direct database access were added to `wrk01-live`, and no new secret was introduced** |
| `continue-on-error` | **0 occurrences** in the workflow, so no step conclusion is masked |

#### Observed evidence — the literal marker lines

**PRE-FIX leg, at `acd2cc5`:**

```
WRK01-MARK FIXTURE present rows=4
WRK01-MARK SERVICE-CALLED getExerciseProgression
WRK01-MARK RESULT len=0
WRK01-MARK ASSERT-NONEMPTY FAIL
```

**POST-FIX leg, same fixture, same probe, at `8843c33`:**

```
WRK01-MARK FIXTURE seeded rows=4
WRK01-MARK SERVICE-CALLED getExerciseProgression
WRK01-MARK RESULT len=3
WRK01-MARK ASSERT-NONEMPTY PASS
WRK01-MARK ASSERT-ALL PASS
```

**Cleanup:**

```
WRK01-MARK CLEANUP verified remaining=0
```

Run-level: all six jobs `success`; `wrk01-live` steps 1–7 all `success`.

#### Observed evidence versus conclusion — stated separately, because §2 turns on it

**Observed** (the marker lines above and the run/job/step outcomes): the same four fixture
rows were present to both legs · both legs reached the real `getExerciseProgression()` ·
the pre-fix call **returned** `[]` rather than throwing · the non-empty expectation is the
assertion that **failed** pre-fix · the post-fix call returned **3** progression points and
every assertion passed · **0** fixture rows survived teardown.

**Concluded from it** — and labelled as conclusion, not as observation: the defect was in
the column name the service read and nothing else, because only the tree changed between
the two legs; and policies, grants, triggers and PostgREST **compose** as §2 says VERIFIED
LIVE proves, because a real request against QA reproduced the correct behaviour where the
identical request against the pre-fix tree did not.

**Not claimed.** §2 is explicit that VERIFIED LIVE *"does not prove … that the user-facing
path reaches it, or that no collateral regression occurred."* **`VERIFIED END-TO-END` is
NOT claimed for `I-WRK-01`** — no human or driver reached the strength-progression surface,
and its class does not require one.

#### Evidence provenance, recorded

The **repository-side** facts in this subsection — the job definition, the probe source,
the pre-fix ref and its `created_at` references, the discrimination gates, the guard state,
the credential posture and the absence of `continue-on-error` — were read directly at
`8843c33` when this subsection was written.

The **run-side** facts — the run and job ids, the step outcomes and the literal marker
lines — were **transcribed by the product owner from the raw job log** retrieved with
repository admin credentials (`gh run view 33129000361 --job 98714155399 --log`). Raw job
logs return **HTTP 403** to this programme's unauthenticated read, exactly as recorded in
§7.13's limitation note. The owner supplied them as authoritative runtime evidence. **They
were not inferred**, and the alternatives that *would* have been inference were explicitly
refused at the gate: the job conclusion, the green run summary, the
*"2 tests passed, 1 failed"* check-run annotation, the harness's fail-closed control flow,
source inspection of the probe, and the post-fix result were each rejected as substitutes
for the PRE-FIX observation before it was supplied.

#### The discrimination that makes the pre-fix leg evidence rather than noise

`wrk01_live_probe.sh:149–163` gates the pre-fix leg with eight assertions, each of which
aborts the job. Recorded because it is what separates *"the fix works"* from *"the runner
was broken"*: the pre-fix run must have initialised Supabase (`BOOT ok`) and authenticated
(`AUTH ok`); it must have seen the **same** fixture (`FIXTURE present rows=4`); it must have
reached the real service (`SERVICE-CALLED getExerciseProgression`); it must have **returned**
rather than thrown (`RESULT len=`), because a throw is not the historical signature; it must
have returned **empty** (`RESULT len=0`), or the harness `die`s on the grounds that a pre-fix
tree returning data is not evidence; the failing assertion must be the **non-empty** one
(`ASSERT-NONEMPTY FAIL`); and `PRE_RC` must be non-zero, because *"a pre-fix tree that passes
is not evidence."* This is context for the observed lines, **not a substitute for them**.

#### Promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED` — 1 row, uncounted

| Row | From | Closing evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **`I-WRK-01`** (= `H-01`, `M-07`, `M R-2` — retired aliases, §3) · §7.6 · P1/P2 ⚠ | NOT `VERIFIED_CLOSED`, three of four states | All four **Data contract / schema** states: **FIXED IN CODE** (`654b09c`) · **FIXED ON QA** (`logged_at` present in QA's live catalog, §7.6) · **VERIFIED IN CI** (run #35, both allowlist halves removed and checked in both directions) · **VERIFIED LIVE** (run #41 — pre-fix `RESULT len=0` / `ASSERT-NONEMPTY FAIL`, post-fix `RESULT len=3` / `ASSERT-ALL PASS`, one fixture, real service, `CLEANUP verified remaining=0`) |

#### Board effect — no count moved, and the divergence widens by one

**`I-WRK-01` is a §7 P1 row and the P1–P3 register carries no per-row status field**, so its
movement is **not** mechanically countable. This is the `F-J-12` position (§7.12,
`REMEDIATION_PROGRESS.md` §3) and D-1 already applied it to this row. The status table is
therefore **deliberately NOT adjusted**: `37 + 48 + 24 + 178 + 4 + 28 = 319`, unchanged. §5
counts canonical findings rather than rows, and `I-WRK-01` was already inside the Data
Contract domain's 33, so no domain total changes either. Which bucket the table currently
holds `I-WRK-01` in **cannot be determined from this repository and was not guessed.**

The narrative `VERIFIED_CLOSED` figure moves **29 → 30**, and the table still says **28**.
**The divergence is now exactly two rows — `F-J-12` and `I-WRK-01` — and it is deliberate**,
for the same reason in both cases. It is disclosed on the progress board rather than
resolved by a guess.

#### What this closure does NOT do

- **`EC-11` is not started and `WorkoutService` was not touched** — `catch (` count remains
  **14**. `EC-11`'s `Dep` cell is unchanged and still reads `I-WRK-01` + `I-COM-01` +
  `I-CHK-01` (D-3); **two of its three dependencies remain open**, so satisfying one does
  not release it.
- **`H-02` / `I-COM-01` is not continued and not closed.** Its closure class has never been
  ruled and remains an open authority question.
- **`D-4` and `D-5` remain unresolved** and are carried forward unchanged. The severity
  disagreement (Workstream I **P1** / Workstream H **P2**) and the self-contradictory site
  count are preserved, not resolved: closure on the evidence ladder does not settle either,
  and §10.2 keeps the A–N reports frozen.
- **No closure criterion, status vocabulary, tracking model or acceptance criterion was
  modified**, and **no waiver was introduced**.
- No other row's status was examined. `I-COM-02`, `I-CHK-01`, `I-LEG-03`, `EC-10`, `SEC-04`,
  `I-MIG-03`/`SEC-09` and the remaining five findings without a tracking home (§7.14) are
  untouched and remain open.

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not
contacted. No REST, RPC, Auth, Storage, Realtime or Edge Function request was issued to it.
No migration was applied, reverted or pushed to it. No Edge Function was deployed to it. The
linked project remained `eyqtldjqpgpljlqvpowh` throughout. The QA writes cited are those of
run #41's own fixture lifecycle under the D-2(b) authorization, which had already executed
and which proved its own teardown; **this checkpoint performed no QA write and no QA read**
and changed governance documents only.

### 7.16 `PD-A23` answered and `UIX-1` / `M-03` remediated — 2026-08-28 · owner rulings + Wave 3A task 3A-8

Two owner rulings and one implementation. **No migration, schema, RLS, Edge Function,
credential, secret or CI change; production not contacted; no QA write and no QA read.**
No status count was moved and **nothing is promoted to `VERIFIED_CLOSED`.**

#### The two rulings, recorded before anything was built

- **`PD-A23` = option (b)**, product owner, 2026-08-28, owner column **engineering**.
  Drop the PostgREST embed; read coach profiles in a second query against
  `public_profiles`; join in Dart; **no migration**; option (a) not implemented.
  Recorded in [`decision-log.md`](decision-log.md) and the register row marked
  `ANSWERED`, per `MASTER_PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` §2 steps 1 and 2. Step 3 is a no-op —
  `UIX-1` was already `READY_TO_REMEDIATE`, never `BLOCKED_DECISION` — and step 4 is the
  progress-board entry accompanying this subsection.
- **`UIX-1` / `M-03` closure class = PRODUCT INTEGRITY / UI REACHABILITY**, product
  owner, 2026-08-28. §2.1's row verbatim: *"FIXED IN CODE · VERIFIED IN CI · VERIFIED
  END-TO-END (a human or a driver reached the surface)"*. The ruling states that
  `FIXED ON QA` and `VERIFIED LIVE` are **not** part of this class, and neither is
  claimed. **This is the first closure class this programme has assigned to a row before
  its remediation rather than after**, and it was requested precisely because the
  §7.15 experience showed the rung question is owner-reserved.

**Why the class was not inferred.** The prior gate established that no document assigned
one: every explicit assignment in this repository — `EC-01` (RELEASE / ENVIRONMENT),
`F-J-12` (SECURITY / AUTHORIZATION, ruling M-4), `I-WRK-01` (Data contract / schema,
ruling D-2) — came from an owner ruling, never from a domain heading. §5's fourteen
*domains* and §2.1's eight *classes* are different taxonomies and no rule maps one to the
other; `EC-01` sits in the Error Contract domain and was ruled RELEASE / ENVIRONMENT.

#### Root cause, read from the migrations

`000_baseline_preexisting_tables.sql:237` —
`coach_client_relationships_coach_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (coach_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id)`.
PostgREST resolves an embedded resource through a foreign key and **cannot traverse one
whose target is outside the `public` schema**, so `coach:coach_id(...)` was answered
`PGRST200` before any row was read. Workstream M recorded the live error and the
embed-free control returning the client's real active relationship (`…_M_…REPORT.md`
§M-03) — that is the BEFORE state, and it is frozen evidence under §10.2.

**The FK is the only one of its kind that the client embeds.** Derived from the migration
set: **134** foreign-key pairs; every other embedded column in `apps/mobile/lib`,
`apps/api/src` and `supabase/functions` resolves into `public` — `coaching_calls.coach_id`,
`classes.coach_id`, `community_posts.user_id`, `post_comments.user_id`,
`accountability_pods.coach_id`, `coach_reviews.client_id`, `weekly_checkins.user_id` and
`coach_team_members.member_id` all reference `public.user_profiles`. **`checkin_screen.dart:118`
carries the identical `coach:coach_id(...)` spelling and is NOT a defect** — its FK lands in
`public` — so it was not touched, and no allowlist entry was needed for it.

#### The guard — built because the existing one is blind by construction

Workstream M's own §10 recorded the gap: *"there is no test asserting that a screen's query
shape matches the live schema, which is exactly the class of bug M-02/M-03/M-04/M-07/M-09
belong to."* Two structural reasons the schema-contract guard could not see this one:

1. `run.mjs`'s `selectColumns()` drops bracketed spans whole, because they are an embedded
   resource's own column list — so the embed head was never examined.
2. Its select matcher reads **one string literal**. Dart concatenates adjacent literals, and
   this defect was written across three of them, so only `'coach_id, status, pending_at,
   activated_at, '` was ever parsed.

The guard added closes both, and closes them for the **class**, not the instance:

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| `deriveForeignKeys()` — replays `ALTER TABLE … FOREIGN KEY` and column-level `REFERENCES` in file order, returning the referenced schema and table | `supabase/tests/contract/schema.mjs` |
| `selectSpecJoined()` — joins adjacent string literals across the whole `.select(…)` argument. **Used only by the embed check**; the column check's input is deliberately unchanged, so no existing verdict moves | `supabase/tests/contract/run.mjs` |
| `embedHeads()` + the check — every head spelled `alias:column` or a bare column must resolve through a FK whose target schema is `public`. A head spelled `relation!hint` names the relation and is covered by the existing relation pass | `supabase/tests/contract/run.mjs` |
| Self-test — two anchors read from the migrations (`coach_client_relationships.coach_id` must be `auth`, `coaching_calls.coach_id` must be `public`). A guard that silently parsed nothing would otherwise pass forever (§4) | `supabase/tests/contract/run.mjs` |

It is **offline and deterministic**: it contacts no environment, reads no credential, and
derives everything from `supabase/migrations` and the source tree. It runs inside
`npm run test:contract`, which the `static-guards` job already executes, so **no CI change
was made or needed**.

#### Pre-fix / post-fix evidence — the guard's own demonstration

Both legs run the **same** guard; only `booking_screen.dart` differs. The pre-fix leg used
the file exactly as committed at `f109f19`, restored byte-identically afterwards
(`bd57f50092d8e5af` before and after).

**PRE-FIX — `f109f19`'s `booking_screen.dart`, exit status 1:**

```
  FAIL   embed    coach_client_relationships.coach_id is embedded but no foreign key reaches the public schema
           at apps/mobile/lib/features/booking/presentation/booking_screen.dart:55 (embed 'coach:coach_id' -> auth.users)

FAIL  1 contract violation(s)
```

**POST-FIX — the remediated file, exit status 0:**

```
Schema contract guard — 91 tables + 5 views + 134 foreign keys derived from supabase/migrations
…
PASS  no unknown relation or column outside the 9-entry known-violations allowlist
```

**The nine allowlist lines are byte-identical in both legs** — `checkins`, `coach_tips`,
`custom_exercises.approved_by`, `event_registrations.ticket_code`, `user_profiles.goal`,
three `nutrition_logs` columns and `user_profiles.equipment`. No other finding's evidence
moved, and `known-violations.json` was not edited.

**Observed versus concluded, stated separately.** *Observed:* the two guard runs above and
their exit statuses; the 134 FK pairs and the two anchor targets; the nine unchanged
allowlist lines. *Concluded:* that the remediated screen will now resolve coach profiles
live — which is a conclusion, not an observation, and is exactly what the class's
VERIFIED END-TO-END rung exists to test.

**Limitation, recorded and not worked around.** This is a **local** run. §4 is explicit
that *"a passing suite that has never run in CI"* is not a closure, so **VERIFIED IN CI is
recorded as PENDING, not satisfied**, until `static-guards` executes on this tree. There
is also **no Dart or Flutter toolchain** on the device or in the cloud container (SDK
archives return HTTP 000, re-verified 2026-08-28), so `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`
could not run and **the Dart edit has not been compiled**. Brace, paren and bracket balance
was checked mechanically as a floor, which is not a substitute for the analyzer.

#### What this checkpoint does NOT do

- **`VERIFIED END-TO-END` is absent and `UIX-1` is NOT `VERIFIED_CLOSED`.** Step 4 is not
  authorized to begin (§7.10), and the structural consequence recorded there for SEC-R2 and
  SEC-R3 applies here too: a row in a class that terminates END-TO-END cannot close before
  Step 4 runs. No waiver was sought and no substitute was recorded.
- **No status count was moved.** `UIX-1` is a §6 P0 row and therefore *is* mechanically
  countable — unlike `F-J-12` and `I-WRK-01` — but it moved from `READY_TO_REMEDIATE` to
  `REMEDIATED`, and §2's table counts neither transition as a closure. `VERIFIED_CLOSED`
  stays **28** and the canonical total stays **319**.
- **`EC-11` not started; `H-02` / `I-COM-01` not continued; `I-WRK-01` not reopened.**
  `workout_service.dart` untouched, `catch (` count **14**.
- **`checkin_screen.dart` not touched.** Its embed resolves and is not a defect.
- **`D-4` and `D-5` unchanged.** The remaining Wave 3A tasks — 3A-1/2/3 (`I-NUT-01`,
  `I-INT-01`, `F-J-04`), 3A-4, 3A-6, 3A-7, 3A-9/10/11 — were not examined or started.
- **No other row's status was examined.**

**Production statement (closure standard §6):** production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was not
contacted. No REST, RPC, Auth, Storage, Realtime or Edge Function request was issued to it.
No migration was applied, reverted or pushed to it. No Edge Function was deployed to it —
`ENV-7` remains `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` and deliberately undeployed. The linked project
remained `eyqtldjqpgpljlqvpowh` throughout. **No QA write and no QA read were performed by
this checkpoint**; every run cited above is offline.

| **EB-1** | `QA_SERVICE` (a scoped QA service-role key) exists in no working copy | `npm run test:security` (188 assertions), `test:ai` live half, `setup-identities.mjs`. **Phase 1's evidence cannot be re-verified, and §4.2 proves it has drifted** | whoever holds the QA keys | 1 — **RESOLVED 2026-08-25**: `QA_URL`/`QA_ANON`/`QA_SERVICE` provisioned as repository secrets; the live-qa job executed for the first time (surfacing W1B-N8) |
| **EB-2** | Zero Edge Functions deployed to QA; `supabase secrets list` → `{"secrets":[]}` | Every AI, payment, invite and enrichment surface. 10 of J's findings and the whole of D's smoke matrix | DevOps | 5 |
| **EB-3** | QA Vault `project_url` / `service_role_key` unset | The coaching crons (fail-closed, correctly, so they are inert). **QA values only — the migration comment exists because a production URL was once pasted in** | DevOps | 5 |
| **EB-4** | Intelligence substrate unpopulated (0 profiles / 621 exercises; 0 graph nodes and edges) | Any real engine decision; AI-5, F-J-09, F-J-22 | Content owner + **D-1** | 5 |
| **EB-5** | No Stripe test-mode account, QA webhook endpoint, QA signing secret, or five QA price ids; `STRIPE_PK` empty in `qa.json`; the runbooks name **production only** and there is no QA equivalent | Every dynamic billing assertion in Workstream K. The embedded-checkout path is untestable in the only safe environment | DevOps + finance | 6 |
| **EB-6** | `API_BASE_URL` empty in every environment; the NestJS API runs nowhere | The AI Nutrition Coach in **all** environments | **D-2(L)** | 1/5 |
| **EB-7** | Resend sender domain unset — the default delivers **only** to the Resend account owner | Every email test is a silent no-op against any other recipient | DevOps | 5 |
| **EB-8** | No Deno runtime; no `deno.json`, import map or lockfile in `supabase/` | Any Edge Function test. **Standing up `deno test` with mocked `fetch` would convert two-thirds of D's smoke matrix into CI** | DevOps | 8 |
| **EB-9** | No runtime UI harness — no integration-test driver, no device | Every UI finding in M is static + query-replay evidence; none was observed on a running screen | QA | 9 |
| **EB-10** | No QA content-editor or coach credential available to the workstreams | Re-measuring the exercise library, the certification pipeline, and the coach half of H-06 | whoever holds the QA keys | 5 |
| **EB-11** | No staging environment and no `dart_defines/staging.json` | Gate 2 in its entirety. **Beta is currently undefined** (D-4 in L) | release engineering | 8 |
| **EB-12** *(added 2026-08-24, Wave 1 batch)* | No Supabase Management API credential in any working copy, and `GET /auth/v1/settings` does not expose HIBP state — the CLI's keychain token is off-limits per governance | `R-06` (leaked-password protection). One dashboard action by the owner: QA project → Authentication → Policies → enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords", then record before/after in `WAVE_1_BATCH_CLOSURE.md` §3 | product owner / DevOps | 1 |

## 9. Production exposure register

Production `nxdbooufqzkpslkcogxc` was **not contacted** by this reconciliation or by any
workstream. Everything here is **UNVERIFIABLE** and derived from source. It is recorded
so the rollout plan has an input; **nothing here is authorization to act.**

| # | Exposure | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SEC-01…SEC-05 are live in production.** They are properties of the migration source. 113–122 close them on QA only | SRC |
| 2 | Migrations `083/084/086/087/090/091/097/099` state in their own headers that they were *never applied in any environment* before their in-place correction. **Production therefore probably has no content pipeline, no certification view, no `exercise_intelligence` table and no per-attribute review** — the largest single schema divergence in the product | SRC |
| 3 | 076's `B2-6` correction and its Vault-based cron retarget **do not self-apply** to an environment that already ran the old 076. Production may still POST to production Edge Functions from a cron created by a QA replay, and `ai_cron_generate` raises on every scheduled run once Vault is configured | SRC |
| 4 | Migration 109 (`auth.users` trigger) is deliberately not auto-applied. It is written name-agnostic and idempotent, so it is safe — applying it is a separate decision | SRC |
| 5 | Migration 102 must not reach production until every beta build reads display names from `public_profiles` / `conversation_participant_profiles` — **and H-06 proves five surfaces still do not** | SRC + LIVE |
| 6 | `dietary_restrictions` is `text` on QA; the in-code comment asserts the live column is `text[]`, implying an out-of-band production change. **Q-6** | LIVE (QA) + UNVERIFIABLE (prod) |
| 7 | `supabase/STRIPE_CONNECT_SETUP.md` claims `stripe-connect`, `create-checkout` and `stripe-webhook` are "already deployed" — a documentation assertion of unknown age. **If true, E-06, E-07, K-01 and E-14 are live in production today, and K-01 is a financial defect** | UNVERIFIABLE |
| 8 | The production Stripe slot holds a `pk_test_` publishable key. Either real money has never moved, or the constant is wrong. **D-1(L)** determines whether existing subscription records are real | SRC |
| 9 | Production's `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` has never been dumped or reconciled against source | UNVERIFIABLE |
| 10 | The daily keep-alive GitHub workflow is the **only** automation that contacts production, and it is the only workflow in the repository | SRC-V |

## 10. How to use this registry

1. **Never mark `VERIFIED_CLOSED` from a code diff.** The evidence ladder in
   `QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD.md` is mandatory and has five distinct states.
2. **Update the row, not a report.** The A–N reports are frozen evidence. When a finding
   moves, this file and `REMEDIATION_PROGRESS.md` move.
3. **A regression re-opens a row; it does not create one.** §4.2 is the pattern. Add the
   regressing change to the row's evidence and reset the status.
4. **A new finding needs an ID, a root cause from §1, and a wave.** If it does not map to
   a CRC, that is a signal the root-cause model is incomplete — extend §1 deliberately
   rather than filing an orphan.
5. **The alias map (§3) is closed.** Do not resurrect a retired ID.
