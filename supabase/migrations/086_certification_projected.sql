-- Migration 086 — Certification: Current + Projected
--
-- Replaces the 084 view so each module certification splits into:
--   • current_*  — consumable NOW (passes the approved/published gate)
--   • projected_* — what it WOULD be certified for once approved (content is
--     ready; a human approval flips the gate + sets human_reviewed)
--
-- This powers the motivating review UX: "Current 0% → After approval 92% —
-- approving unlocks AI Coach, Self-Guided, Marketplace, Program Generator."
-- Depends on 084 (and 083). Idempotent.
