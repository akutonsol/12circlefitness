-- Migration 097 — Layered Exercise Media · Phase 1: Coach Overlay
--
-- Identity feature (deliberate pre-beta exception): the official library is never
-- the final experience — every coach can OVERLAY their own coaching on any
-- exercise. Not replace — override pieces (a focus, a note, their own video).
-- The resolver walks: client → coach → official. Voice is a first-class future
-- slot; text ("Coach Focus Today") is the highest-adoption path and ships now.
--
-- Depends on 025 (coach_client_relationships). Idempotent.
