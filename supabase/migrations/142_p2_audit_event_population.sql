-- Migration 142 — P2 · the AUDIT EVENT population, and the two roles it reads through.
--
-- P2's entry conditions are satisfied: §5.2 gates P2 on D4 + D12; D4 completed at
-- V5 §19.2, D12's content at §74, and SQ-10 -- the added entry condition (§8.10) --
-- was answered by §19.3's Q1. The schema below is the one D4 already decided. Nothing
-- here is a new audit design; every object cites the ruling that produced it, and
-- V5 §75 carries the full specification this implements.
--
-- SCOPE. This migration builds ONE of D4's four populations -- the Event population
-- (A1 §8.4, population 1). Incident, Control evidence and the D12 observability
-- population are separate objects with separate rulings and are NOT built here.
--
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- CLAIM LIMITS. These are RULINGS, not commentary. Each forbids a claim this
-- schema would otherwise imply, and each is carried into the object comments so
-- it survives away from this file (V5 §75.4):
--
--   1. NO TAMPER-RESISTANCE CLAIM. A11 sub-ruling 2 requires an out-of-database
--      trust anchor before any meaningful append-only claim. §8.19 DECLINED the
--      anchor, so the binding below is DML-DEEP ONLY. It binds every caller
--      including service_role; it binds nobody at the DDL layer.
--   2. NO UNIVERSAL ACCESS-LOGGING CLAIM. A3 sub-ruling 1 / A11 sub-ruling 4:
--      PHI-read audit observes only RPC-routed reads -- 8.7% of the client's
--      data-access calls. No document may describe PHI-read auditing as complete.
--   3. THREE ACCEPTED BLIND SPOTS (A3 sub-ruling 2): RLS authorization denials,
--      managed authentication events, storage/media reads. They are IN under A2
--      and unemittable by any path. They must not be represented as audited.
--   4. ANONYMISATION IS NOT IRREVERSIBLE. §8.20·Q4 -- severance binds at the DML
--      layer and is not durable against a party holding DDL rights.
--   5. THE CORRELATION IDENTIFIER IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY AGAINST THE FUNCTION TIER.
--      V5 §71.1, normative. §68 demonstrated a compromised Edge Function obtains
--      valid signatures on demand, defeating all five signer designs. Signing is
--      DETECTION, never prevention, against that adversary.

-- erasure. The Trust operator is therefore NOT the role A12 ruling 6 mandated --
-- that remains a distinct second role."
--
-- A12 ruling 6 asked whether the erasure executor may be service_role: NO.
-- Both values are added in ONE constraint change rather than two, but only
-- trust_operator is USED here -- the erasure flow is a later migration.
-- §19.3 forbids a THIRD role; these are the two, and no more are created.

-- ── 2 · THE EVENT POPULATION (A1 §8.4 population 1) ─────────────────────────
-- A1's shape, verbatim: "append-only occurrence record — actor · subject · action
-- · time · outcome". Every column below is either one of those five or carries its
-- own citation.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.audit_events (
  id            uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  -- A1's five.
  --
  -- DELIBERATELY NO FOREIGN KEY, and the omission is a ruling, not an oversight.
  -- An earlier revision of this migration declared both columns
  -- `REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`. Local validation refuted it on
  -- two independent counts, both of which would have been defects on QA:
  --
  --   1. It makes A3 sub-ruling 3 UNIMPLEMENTABLE. That ruling PERMITS an
  --      application-asserted actor, and §8.5's own consequence names the case:
  --      `stripe-webhook` has no JWT at all and its actor is
  --      `session.metadata.user_id`, "supplied by a third party's payload". An FK
  --      rejects any asserted actor that is not already an auth.users row --
  --      exactly the case the ruling contemplates. Verified: the asserted-actor
  --      probe failed 23503 against the FK.
  --   2. `ON DELETE SET NULL` MUTATES A FROZEN ROW. A11 freezes the Event row and
  --      A12 ruling 2 takes NO exception -- "the frozen row is never mutated";
  --      erasure goes through the external mapping instead. A1 sub-ruling 2 already
  --      forbids the sibling form: audit records "must not be ON DELETE CASCADE'd
  --      merely because the audited subject is deleted." SET NULL is the same
  --      class. It would also have DEADLOCKED against policy: the freeze trigger
  --      below refuses the SET NULL, so deleting a user would fail outright.
  --
  -- The identifiers are therefore stored raw. Referential integrity to auth.users
  -- is not asserted, because the audit ledger must outlive the subject (A12 ruling
  -- 1, ANONYMISE-AND-RETAIN) and must accept actors that were never users.

  -- ruling: server-minted are tagged by origin, client-asserted are tagged
  -- `asserted`. A3's consequence note is why this cannot be omitted: auth.uid() is
  -- NULL on every internal path, current_user cannot distinguish an Edge Function
  -- from pg_cron from a migration, and stripe-webhook's actor arrives inside a
  -- third party's payload.
  actor_provenance text NOT NULL,

  -- A2 §8.3. Required, not decorative: A12 ruling 3 makes retention precedence

-- A11 Event: "identity and occurrence facts are immutable. Any future writable

-- record." This table defines NO annotation field, so every column is an identity
-- or occurrence fact and the whole row is frozen. Adding a writable annotation

--
-- MECHANISM, and why this one. A3 sub-ruling 5 requires that service_role be
-- CONSTRAINED from bypassing audit controls; A11 sub-ruling 3 deferred that binding
-- until A12's erasure mechanism was decided, and A12 IS NOW DECIDED, so the deferral

-- UPDATE/DELETE trigger that RAISEs (120_workout_set_identity_authority.sql

-- service_role. Grants and policies bind nothing here -- a compromised Edge Function
-- holds service_role, which bypasses RLS entirely.
