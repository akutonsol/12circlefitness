// D15 · ADMIN SURFACE ACCESS — migrations 156/157, live against QA.
//
// The owner's authorization for these surfaces says: "test the actual resulting
// data access, not merely function return values." D13 proves admin_can() returns
// the right booleans and D14 proves all 425 of them. NEITHER proves a row crosses
// an RLS boundary. This suite reads rows.
//
// WHY MOST ASSERTIONS ARE COUNT COMPARISONS AGAINST SERVICE. A surface test that
// says "the admin got HTTP 200" proves nothing: PostgREST answers 200 with `[]`
// when RLS filters everything, which is exactly how the three coach surfaces in
// SEC-G3 rendered a confident permanent zero. So every positive asserts the
// assigned caller sees THE SAME COUNT the service role sees, and every negative
// asserts an unassigned caller sees ZERO of the same query.
//
// WHY SEVEN OF THE SIXTEEN ARMS ARE ASSERTED AS REDUNDANT, NOT AS GRANTS. The
// baseline measured before 156 (V5 §128.2) showed community_posts, post_comments,
// post_reactions, community_groups, accountability_pods, events and classes are
// ALREADY readable by any authenticated user through policies that predate this
// work. The admin arm on those tables grants nothing that was not already granted.
// Asserting "an admin can read community_posts" would therefore PASS WITHOUT 156
// APPLIED AT ALL -- a vacuous test, and §5.2's "test the class, not the instance"
// cuts against writing one. They are asserted for NON-REGRESSION only, and the
// pre-existing broad posture is recorded as a finding rather than dressed up as a
// result of this migration.
