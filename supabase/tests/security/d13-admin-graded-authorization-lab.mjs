// D13 · GRADED ADMIN AUTHORIZATION — the matrix-INDEPENDENT half, live against QA.
//
// Covers migrations 153 (admin layer) and 154 (governance registry). V5 §113 is
// the specification, §113.3 the least-privilege proof, §118.3 the QA packet.
//
// WHY THIS SUITE IS UNREGISTERED. 153/154 are authored and declared PENDING on QA
// (supabase/expected_applied.json) because no owner authorization to apply them
// exists. Registering it in run.mjs would make CI fail on a migration that is
// deliberately unapplied — the opposite of evidence. It is registered the moment
// they are applied.
//
// WHY IT NEEDS NO CAPABILITY DATA. Every assertion below holds with
// admin_role_capabilities EMPTY. The 85-cell matrix is a separate blocker (V5
// §116) and gates only the grant-specific tests of §A6. These are the structural
// and separation properties, and they are exactly the ones a seeding mistake
// would break.
//
// It CLEANS UP after itself: unlike d12, these tables carry no append-only freeze,
// so the fixture assignment row is removed in a finally block.
