// N-07 — assessment access is coach-of-record only, and every read is logged.
//
// ── WHY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Intake writes 32 columns onto `user_profiles`, including parq_answers,
// risk_level, risk_score, medical_conditions, has_injuries, injury_locations,
// injury_description and food_allergies. Migration 102's SELECT policy grants
// the WHOLE ROW to:
//
//     id = auth.uid()
//     OR public.is_active_coach_of(id)
//     OR public.is_team_lead_of(id)     -- a team ROSTER
//     OR public.hosts_event_for(id)     -- an attendee LIST
//
// 102's own header shows the last two were added so a head coach could see a
// roster and a vendor an attendee list — that is, for NAMES. They carry the
// medical columns with them regardless. N-07's copy, "Only you and Amara can
// see this", is therefore false on the base-table path.
//
// get_client_assessment() is the narrow path: active coach ONLY, and it writes
// an audit row before it returns. This suite asserts that, and asserts the
// base-table exposure separately so the residual finding stays visible rather
// than being masked by the new RPC.
//
// ── STATUS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every assertion below requires the proposed migration in
// docs/proposed/N07_assessment_access.sql, which is authored and NOT applied —
// `docs/MASTER_REMEDIATION_WAVES.md` §0.2 assigns migration numbers 132+ at
// wave entry, never before. Until it is numbered, applied and registered in
// run.mjs, this suite fails by design. That is the pre-fix reading, not a
// defect — the same convention d08 records for migration 131. Do not delete it
// to make the runner green.

// POSITIVE allowlist, matching d07/d08/d10/d11. `lib.mjs` only BLOCKS the
// production ref, and "is not production" is not "is QA" — a third project
// would sail straight through.
//
// This suite needs the guard more than any other in the directory, because its
// arrange step issues service_role DELETEs against `coach_client_relationships`
// and `assessment_access_log` filtered only by client_id. Pointed at the wrong

// ── BEFORE THIS SUITE MAY BE REGISTERED IN run.mjs ──────────────────────────
// Two things must be true, and neither is today:
//
//   1. N-07's migration must be numbered, applied and its objects present.
//      `get_client_assessment()` and `assessment_access_log` do NOT exist —
//      zero references in supabase/migrations, zero in the live QA catalog —
//      so all seven RPC assertions below would fail on a missing function
//      rather than on a boundary. N-07 is blocked on owner decision OD-30
//      ("coach access to PAR-Q"), so there is no date for this.
//
//   2. The arrange step must stop mutating SHARED fixture state. `reset()`
//      DELETEs every coach_client_relationships row for the victim — the same
//      fixture d01 asserts on. That is the cross-suite contamination class that
//      made a d11 assertion vacuous in V5 §33.4, and it must be fixed before
//      this suite runs alongside the others, not after.
//
// Until both hold, this file is committed but NOT registered: it is preserved
// evidence, not part of the green suite. Registering it today would add no
// coverage of anything that exists and would make CI permanently red.
