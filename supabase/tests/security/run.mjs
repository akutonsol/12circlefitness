//
// ⚠ ONE RUNNER AT A TIME, PER QA PROJECT. "Sequentially" covers the suites inside
// one process; NOTHING here prevents two runners from colliding. Because every
// suite arranges the SAME four identities and the SAME relationship rows against

//
// Observed, V5 §95: a local run at 19:55-19:58Z overlapped CI's live-security step
// at 19:54:40-19:56:16Z. CI came out 480/484 with D-01 41/43 and P1 35/37, while
// the local run of the same commit was 484/484. All four CI failures cascaded from
// ONE arrange step -- `insert=409 readback=active`, i.e. the relationship row
// already existed and the other runner held it 'active' -- and one of them,
// "relationship 'cancelled' -> coach is DENIED the client photo (status=200)",
// READS EXACTLY LIKE AN AUTHORIZATION HOLE AND IS NOT ONE: its precondition never
// held, so the relationship was active and the coach was legitimately permitted.
//
// So: before running this locally, check that no CI run is in flight
// (`gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1`). A red result from a collision is
// indistinguishable at a glance from a real regression, which is the whole reason
// this warning is here rather than in a commit message.

// The warning above has been a comment since V5 §95, and a comment did not stop it
// happening again: V5 §146 records a local run of this file overlapping CI's
// live-qa step, which left a coach_client_relationship visible to the AI suite that
// runs next and failed `J-04` on an invariant that had nothing to do with the
// change under test. Locally the same sequence leaves zero rows and J-04 passes
// 16/16 — the failure was the collision, not the code.
//
// .githooks/pre-push closed the OTHER half of this rule (don't push over a run).
// This closes the half that actually corrupts fixtures: don't RUN over a run.
//
// Fails CLOSED when a run is in flight; fails OPEN when it cannot tell — no `gh`,
// offline, unauthenticated, or not a git checkout — because refusing to test
// because a CLI is missing is worse than the problem it prevents.

// The concurrency guard now lives in lib.mjs, so it protects EVERY suite — including
// a suite run on its own, which is how the §161 fixture leak happened.
