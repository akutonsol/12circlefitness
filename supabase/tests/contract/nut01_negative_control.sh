# I-NUT-01 / E-13 / E-NUT-04 / F-J-03 — negative control for the schema-contract
# column guard, Wave 3A task 3A-1.
#
# QA_CLOSURE_STANDARD §2 defines VERIFIED IN CI as a check that "fails against
# the pre-fix tree and passes against the post-fix tree, IN CI". The column
# guard in supabase/tests/contract/run.mjs passes on the fixed tree, but the
# pre-fix tree carried `nutrition_logs.protein_g / carbs_g / fat_g` inside the
# known-violations allowlist, so on its own the guard never demonstrates the
# failure. This harness supplies the missing half: it installs the pre-fix
# Edge Function against the POST-FIX allowlist, requires the three named
# failures, restores byte-identically and requires the pass again.
#
# It follows uix1_negative_control.sh exactly. It does not touch application
# behaviour, does not weaken the guard, adds no allowlist entry, and contacts
# nothing.
#
# THE PRE-FIX STATE IS REAL, NOT SYNTHETIC. ai-coaching-engine/index.ts at the
# reference below carries the actual defect: `.from('nutrition_logs')
# .select('calories, protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g')`, while 006_nutrition_logs.sql
# names those columns `protein`, `carbs`, `fat`. A defective tree is therefore
# recoverable from history and **G-3 is NOT invoked**. This step must never be
# filed alongside the WKT-204 and M-1/M-2/M-3 steps, which are of that
# synthetic class.
#
# No credential, no network, no toolchain: `npm run test:contract` is
# `node supabase/tests/contract/run.mjs`, which imports only node builtins and
# reads no environment variable.
